**Abstract:** (1) Background: ADHD is recognized as one of the most common neurodevelopmental
disorders. The worldwide prevalence of ADHD is estimated at 5.3%; however, estimates vary as a
function of a number of factors, including diagnostic methods, age, sex and geographical location. A
review of studies is needed to clarify the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada. (2) Methods: A search
strategy was created in PubMed and adapted for MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Papers were included
if they examined diagnosed ADHD prevalence and/or incidence rates in any region of Canada, age
group and gender. A snowball technique was used to identify additional papers from reference lists,
and experts in the field were consulted. (3)Results: Ten papers included in this review reported
on prevalence, and one reported on incidence. One study provided an overall prevalence estimate
across provinces for adults of 2.9%, and one study provided an overall estimate across five provinces
for children and youth of 8.6%. Across age groups (1 to 24 years), incidence estimates ranged from
0.4% to 1.2%, depending on province. Estimates varied by age, gender, province, region and time.
(4) Conclusions: The overall Canadian ADHD prevalence estimate is similar to worldwide estimates
for adults. Most studies reported on prevalence rather than incidence. Differences in estimates
across provinces may reflect the varying number of practitioners available to diagnose and prescribe
medication for ADHD across provinces. To achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the
epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes all provinces and territories, and
that considers estimates in relation to age, gender, ethnicity, geographical region, socioeconomic status
and access to mental healthcare coverage. Incidence rates need further examination to be determined.

**1. Introduction**
    Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is recognized as the most common
neurodevelopmental disorder of childhood. A frequently cited study by Polanszky of
2007 reported a worldwide ADHD prevalence estimate of 5.3% [ 1 ]. Studies carried out in
countries other than Canada showed a range of ADHD estimates. For instance, estimates
for children include 7.5% in Australia [ 2 ] and 10.2% in the United States [ 3 ]. Two studies on
adolescents in China and Africa provided estimates of 6.3% [ 4 ] and 7.5% [ 5 ], respectively.
One German study on children and adolescents combined provides an estimate of 6.1% [ 6 ].
Estimates are typically lower for adults than for children and adolescents [ 7 ]. A 2021 survey
conducted in the United States, for example, found an ADHD prevalence rate for adults of
4.25% [ 8 ]. Findings from two recent worldwide meta-analyses suggest a prevalence of 3.4%
in children and adolescents [9], and a lower prevalence in adults of 2.6% [10].
    In addition to potential differences between countries, prevalence estimates may also
vary due to the methods used and sample characteristics. Additionally, while prevalence es-
timates indicate the number of existing cases of a disorder in the population (existing + new
cases over total population), incidence estimates indicate the number of new cases beingadded (i.e., new cases over total (susceptible) population). When the duration of a disorder
is short, and new instances are constant or increasing, incidence can trend higher than
prevalence. However, when the duration of a disorder tends to be lifelong (as is the case
for ADHD), prevalence can trend higher than incidence because new cases are added and
existing cases remain. Thus, prevalence and incidence provide unique information which
combined, help to clarify the epidemiology of ADHD.
A few studies have examined the prevalence and/or incidence of ADHD specifically
in the Canadian population, but these findings have not yet been summarized. Toclarify
the epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a review of existing studies on the prevalence and
incidence of diagnosed ADHD is needed. The aim of this review is to summarize Canadian
ADHD prevalence and incidence estimates published in the past ten years and to consider
these in relation to demographic (i.e., age and gender), geographic and methodological factors.

**2. Materials and Methods**

A search strategy to identify relevant literature using Boolean operators was developed
using PubMed and adapted for Medline, and PsycInfo with the following terms: (ADHD
or ADD or AD/HD or Attention *) and (Canada or Canadian or province * or territory or
territory *) and (epidemiology, prevalence, incidence). All studies were screened, and data
were abstracted by two reviewers. A snowball technique (i.e., examining reference lists of
selected papers) and experts were consulted to identify additional relevant papers. Papers
published within the past 10 years (2012 to 2022) were included if they provided estimates
of diagnosed ADHD prevalence or incidence based on data from the Canadian population,
regardless of age group, gender or geographical location examined. Papers that focused on
symptoms of ADHD without a diagnosis (e.g., self-reported attention difficulties) and that
focused on a particular environmental condition (e.g., ADHD with greenspace exposure or
traumatic brain injury) were excluded.

**3. Results**
3.1. Description of Included Papers

A total of ten papers are included in the review [ 11 – 20 ], all of which were pub-
lished from 2012 to 2022 (see Table 1). Tenpapers included prevalence estimates of ADHD
in Canada [ 11 – 20 ]. Outof these papers, one also examined the incidence of ADHD in
Canada [ 15 ]. One additional review paper [ 21 ] that was initially included, was ultimately
excluded because it did not provide prevalence or incidence estimates. This paper was re-
viewed to ensure that any relevant studies mentioned were included here. See Appendix A
for a PRISMA diagram [ 22 ] outlining results of the search strategy used to retrieve articles
for the current paper.
This group of studies based estimates on data collected from 1999 [ 11 , 20 ] to 2015/6[12,17,20].
The range for data collection was similar for papers that focused on ADHD prevalence
in children and/or adolescents (1999–2015/6) [ 11 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 ] and those that examined
prevalence in adults (1999–2018) [ 13 – 16 , 19 ]. With regard to data collection methods used to
derive estimates, some papers used primary care EMR data [ 12 ] and health administrative
databases [ 15 – 18 , 20 ], whereas others used national/provincial surveys [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 19 ]. When
papers included multiple prevalence or incidence estimates, the most recent estimate was
used for this review [11,12,15–17,20].
The papers with prevalence estimates included children alone [ 11 , 17 ], adults
alone [13,14,16,19], and a combination of children and adults [ 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 ]. Allsix of the
papers that examined ADHD prevalence in children included preschoolers (i.e., children
under 6 years old) and school-aged children (between 6 to 12 years old), and five included
adolescents (i.e., 13 to 17 years old) [ 12 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 ]. Four papers focused on adults between
the ages of 18 to 65 years old [ 12 – 14 , 19 ]. The one paper that provided incidence estimates
included a combination of children, adolescents and adults (1999–2012) [15].

Four of the papers provided overall prevalence estimates across Canadian provinces
using national datasets [ 12 – 14 ] or nationally administered surveys [ 11 ]; four provided
prevalence estimates for a single province [ 16 – 18 , 20 ]; and one provided prevalence and
incidence estimates for four provinces individually (Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Quebec and
Ontario) [15]. One did not specify geographical location [19].
Regarding gender, while all papers acknowledged gender differences in ADHD preva-
lence, six provided separate estimates for males and females [ 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 ]. The paper
that included incidence estimates differentiated between males and females, although no
exact estimates were provided [ 15 ]. No other non-binary gender identity was noted in any
of the papers. The ethnic background of the participants was reported in only one paper;
the majority were classified as “white” [13].
The diagnosis of ADHD was established based on different informants and methods.
Some relied on physician reports [ 15 – 18 ]; others relied on self-reporting [ 13 , 14 , 19 , 20 ] or
parent/caregiver-report [ 11 ]. Only one study [ 12 ] used an algorithm to identify ADHD
based on information from the participants’ primary care electronic medical records. Six
of the studies used data collected from health administrative datasets [ 12 , 15 – 18 , 20 ], and
the remaining used survey data [ 11 , 13 , 14 , 19 ]. Not all of the papers specified which criteria
were used to determine an ADHD diagnosis [ 11 , 13 , 14 ]. Five of the studies used ICD-
9 diagnostic criteria [ 12 , 15 – 17 , 20 ], and five used ICD-10 criteria [ 15 – 18 , 20 ]. One paper
referred to DSM-IV criteria [19].

3.2. ADHD Prevalence
3.2.1. Overall ADHD Prevalence in Canada

None of the included studies provided an overall national prevalence estimate col-
lapsed across age groups (i.e., children, adolescents and adults combined). However, one
study provided an overall estimate of 2.9% across a large age range (i.e., 20 to 64 years of
age), gender (i.e., male/female) and all provinces [14].

3.2.2. Age Differences

The one study that provided an estimate for children alone (aged 3 to 9 years) indicated
that ADHD prevalence across provinces is approximately 1.1% for preschoolers and 4.1%
for school-aged children [ 11 ]. Of the studies that provided ADHD prevalence estimates
for children and adolescents combined [ 12 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 20 ], estimates ranged from 2.6% [ 17 ]
to 8.6% [ 12 ]. Only one of these studies provided an overall estimate across provinces (i.e.,
Alberta, Manitoba, Newfoundland, Ontario and Quebec) of 8.6% [ 12 ]. Thestudies that
examined ADHD prevalence amongst adults in Canada [ 12 – 16 , 19 ] provided estimates rang-
ing from 2.7% or 2.9% (across all provinces) [ 13 , 14 ] to 7.3% (across five provinces) [ 12 ]. One
study provided separate estimates of ADHD prevalence for young adults (18 to 34 years,
7.3%) and older adults (35 to 64 years, 5.5%) [ 12 ]. Among a specific population of relatively
old (i.e., majority of the sample aged 50 and over) Canadian Forces members and veterans,
ADHD prevalence was estimated at 3.3% (geographical location not specified) [19].
A few of the studies indicate that compared to adults and preschoolers, ADHD diag-
nosis is higher in school-aged children [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 20 ] and young adults [ 12 ]. Inparticular,
one study found that the highest overall annual prevalence rates are in children 5 to14 years
of age, which held true across time (1999–2012) and province (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec,
Nova Scotia) [15].

3.2.3. Gender and Ethnicity Differences

The subset of papers including children indicates that the prevalence of ADHD is
approximately twice as high amongst males compared to females [ 11 , 12 , 15 – 18 ]. Estimates
for males range from 3.7% [ 11 ] to 13.3% [ 20 ]. Estimates for females range from 1.5% [ 11 ]
to 7.0% [ 12 ]. Three studies suggest that this gender gap persists into adulthood [ 12 , 16 , 18 ],
with estimates for adult males ranging from 5.8% [ 12 ] to 10.3% [ 16 ], and for adult females
ranging from 2.6% [16] to 6.5% [12].


None of the studies looked at differences in prevalence by ethnic background. One
study compared differences between first and second-generation immigrants in British
Columbia with a non-immigrant sample [ 20 ]. Prevalence was highest for the non-immigrant
sample (9.2%), followed by the second-generation sample (5.9%). The lowest prevalence
rate was found for the first-generation sample (4.3%).

3.2.4. Socioeconomic and Regional Differences

Only one study looked at Canadian ADHD prevalence rates in relation to socioeco-
nomic status (SES) and region (urban versus rural) [ 16 ]. Thisstudy did not find an SES
gradient in ADHD diagnosis, but when restricted by region, a small negative gradient was
found for urban living and a small positive gradient for rural living. Additionally, adults in
the highest income bracket were less likely than those in other income brackets to receive a
diagnosis of ADHD before age 18.

3.2.5. Provincial Differences

One study looked at differences in estimates across provinces and indicated that ADHD
prevalence may be higher in certain provinces compared to others [ 15 ]. Findings were that
ADHD prevalence amongst children is higher in Nova Scotia (3.8%) and Quebec (3.8%)
compared to Manitoba (2.8%) and Ontario (1.1%). Amongst adults, prevalence is also higher
in Nova Scotia (1.7%) compared to Manitoba (0.8%), Quebec (0.7%) and Ontario (0.5%).

3.2.6. Differences across Time

A number of the studies reviewed here indicate that ADHD diagnosis and the number
of patients prescribed ADHD medication are increasing over time [ 11 , 12 , 15 , 17 ]. One study
reported that the prevalence of ADHD diagnosis in Canada has increased amongst all age
groups—4 to 17-year-olds (6.9–8.6%), 18 to 34-year-olds (5.7–7.3%), and 35 to 64-year-olds
(5.2–5.5%)—from 2008 to 2015, particularly for children and young adults [ 12 ]. Another
study indicated that this upward trend in diagnosis holds across provinces. The highest
increase in ADHD prevalence across time (1999 and 2012) was found for Quebec (3.5%) [ 15 ].
This study suggests that this increase was associated with a shift across time in practitioner
type primarily diagnosing ADHD, from specialists to general practitioners [15].

3.3. ADHD Incidence
3.3.1. Overall ADHD Incidence in Canada

None of the papers included in this review provided an incidence rate for ADHD
across all age groups or using a national sample.

3.3.2. Age Differences

The one paper that examined ADHD incidence did so across a wide age range (1 to
24 years) [ 15 ]. Findings were that incident ADHD diagnosis is highest in 5 to 9-year-olds
(from 0.8% in Ontario to 2.1% in Quebec) and 10 to 14-year-olds (0.5% in Ontario to 1.5% in
Quebec) compared to all other age groups examined. This held true across year of study
(1999 to 2012) and province examined (Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec).

3.3.3. Provincial Differences

Across age groups, the highest incidence estimate was found for Quebec (1.2%),
followed by Nova Scotia (1.0%), Manitoba (0.8%) and Ontario (0.4%) [15].

3.3.4. Differences across Time

Based on one study, there is some indication that ADHD incidence is rising across time
(1999 to 2012) in Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Quebec but remaining stable in Ontario [15].
See Table 1 for articles regarding the prevalence and incidence estimates of ADHD in Canada.

3.4. Which Practitioners Are Diagnosing and Treating ADHD in Canada
According to Vasiliadiset al. (2017) [15], who reported on the incidence of ADHD
in Canada, ADHD diagnoses are primarily made by general practitioners in the three
provinces examined (Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec). In Nova Scotia, diagnoses seem
to be primarily performed by general practitioners (69%), followed by pediatricians (27%)
and then psychiatrists (3%) [ 15 ]. In Ontario, diagnoses also seem to be primarily performed
by general practitioners (52%), then psychiatrists (24%), pediatricians (23%), and other
specialists (<1%) [ 15 ]. In Quebec, the primary sources of incident ADHD diagnoses seem
to be general practitioners (46%) and pediatricians (43%), followed by psychiatrists (8%)
and other specialists (3%) [15]. These statistics are displayed in Figure 1.

**4. Discussion**
    The aim of this review was to examine the prevalence and incidence rates of
diagnosed ADHD in Canada in the past decade. Ten papers were included in this review
that covered all provinces and age groups from preschoolers to older adults. Based on one
paper across five provinces, overall ADHD prevalence in children and youth (ages 4 to 17
years) was estimated to be 8.6% [12], and based on one paper across all provinces, overall
ADHD prevalence in adults (ages 20 to 64 years) is estimated to be 2.9% [14], which is
similar to worldwide estimates in adults [10]. Findings from this review indicate that:
- The prevalence of diagnosed ADHD varies across provinces (from 0.5% in Ontario
    to 3.8% in Nova Scotia).
- The prevalence of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication have increased over
    time (1999–2015) for all age groups and provinces (particularly Quebec with an
    increase in prevalence of 3.5% in just over a decade) [11,12,15,17].
- Prevalence is higher amongst children and adolescents than adults, both within
    individual provinces and across Canada [12,15,18].
- Prevalence is higher amongst males than females at all ages, although the disparity
    may decrease with age [11,17,18,20].
- The incidence of diagnosed ADHD in children and youth varies across provinces
    (from 0.4% in Ontario to 1.2% in Quebec) [15] and has increased over time.
    ADHD prevalence and incidence estimates require further examination, as only two
studies in the past decade have examined prevalence across all provinces. No study covers
all provinces and territories, nor all age groups. These are important gaps, as findings
from the group of studies reviewed here highlight significant variability in estimates by
province and age [e.g., 9]. All studies included here reported information on prevalence,
but only one reported on incidence. Further estimates are needed, particularly of
incidence, to clarify the number of individuals affected and the rate of growth of
individuals with ADHD in the population. For a comprehensive understanding of the
epidemiology of ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes data from all provinces
and territories, and that looks across all age groups, taking a lifespan approach.
    There are a number of future directions and questions that should arise from this
review. While some of the studies looked at estimates in relation to gender, only the
dichotomy of males versus females was used. Additionally, only one study included here

    - The incidence of diagnosed ADHD in children and youth varies across provinces

          ADHD prevalence and incidence estimates require further examination, as only two
studies in the past decade have examined prevalence across all provinces. No study covers
all provinces and territories, nor all age groups. These are important gaps, as findings
from the group of studies reviewed here highlight significant variability in estimates by
province and age, e.g., [ 9 ]. All studies included here reported information on prevalence,
but only one reported on incidence. Further estimates are needed, particularly of incidence,
to clarify the number of individuals affected and the rate of growth of individuals with
ADHD in the population. For a comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of
ADHD in Canada, a study is needed that includes data from all provinces and territories,
and that looks across all age groups, taking a lifespan approach.
    There are a number of future directions and questions that should arise from this
review. While some of the studies looked at estimates in relation to gender, only the di-
chotomy of males versus females was used. Additionally, only one study included here


reported on ethnicity as a variable. Importantly, one study in this review highlighted
variability in prevalence rates related to immigrant and refugee status [ 20 ], and another em-
phasized the need to consider socioeconomic and regional (urban vs. rural) differences [ 16 ].
Another important factor needing attention in epidemiological research is the influence
of mental health insurance coverage on access to service access [ 16 ]. Furtherresearch on
these demographic and socioeconomic variables will help clarify the diverse needs of
individuals with ADHD across the country and inform service delivery. Consideration of
comorbid conditions will also be important for future studies, as approximately 65–80% of
children and 85% of adults with ADHD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder
(anxiety, depression, conduct disorder, etc.). Individuals with ADHD have a 13-year shorter
estimated life expectancy due to both psychiatric and medical comorbidity [23].
Canadian studies on prevalence in the past decade indicate an upward trend in ADHD
diagnosis and medication treatment across time and provinces. One possible explanation is
that variations in study methodology play a role, as found in a recent systematic review
and meta-regression analysis of worldwide studies [ 21 ]. It was concluded that variations in
estimates across those studies can be largely explained by methodological differences, rather
than time or geographical location. Methodological variability is notable both within and
across the studies included in this review, particularly with regard to data sources and case
determination. A unique contribution of this review is that all studies examined diagnosed
ADHD. Screening studies that asked about symptoms related to ADHD without a diagnosis
by a health professional were excluded because the presence of self-reported symptoms
alone does not confirm a diagnosis of ADHD and can result in inflated estimates [ 24 ].
However, a few of the studies included here relied on self- or other-reported diagnosis.
Only six studies out of ten based the presence of ADHD on a diagnosis performed by a
health professional and recorded in the health system [ 12 , 15 – 18 , 20 ]. Toachieve a more
accurate reflection of the prevalence/incidence of ADHD in Canada, it is important that
future studies include only confirmed and documented cases of ADHD.
Differences in taxonomy used to identify ADHD across studies and within studies,
across time, may also influence estimates. Some research suggests that prevalence estimates
based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) may underestimate ADHD
prevalence compared to those that rely on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM) criteria [ 24 – 28 ]. Additionally, diagnostic criteria change across time,
potentially influencing estimates, such as the change in symptom onset and exclusion
criteria from DSM-IV to DSM-V. Important to note is that this review captured only the
prevalence of individuals diagnosed with or treated for ADHD, rather than the prevalence
of all diagnosed and undiagnosed individuals with ADHD. For instance, individuals
diagnosed in the school and mental health systems would not be captured in the six studies
included here that relied on health administrative datasets [ 12 , 15 – 18 , 20 ]. As discussed by
Vassiliadis et al., prevalence estimates based on physician claims may reflect a suspected
or working diagnosis rather than a confirmed one. Administrative datasets may also
miss ADHD diagnoses because comorbidities of anxiety and depression are often present
with ADHD, and claims may be made under billing codes for these conditions instead of
ADHD [ 15 ]. While the use of a wide range of health administrative datasets and publicly
accessible surveys across the country highlights opportunities for gathering comprehensive
epidemiological data on ADHD nationwide, it may be ideal to link data from multiple
sources to most accurately inform case identification.
Provincial differences in ADHD prevalence/incidence and treatments (e.g., prescrip-
tions of stimulants and antidepressants) raise several questions regarding the types of
services and number of practitioners available to diagnose and treat ADHD. While provin-
cial differences may be an important factor influencing prevalence, Canada also has an
additional consideration given its geography, including large distances between commu-
nities and the resulting impact on access to services [ 29 ]. However, the one study in this
review that looked at regional differences found that those in rural or lower-income com-
munities are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD and medicated [ 16 ]. Thisfinding


may depend, in part, on the extent to which ADHD is viewed as a medical condition across
regions and provinces [ 11 ], as well the extent to which parents prefer accessing ADHD
support through medical settings versus school and community settings [11].
Upward trends across time in ADHD diagnosis and treatment may reflect improve-
ments in diagnosis and in ADHD medications (e.g., the introduction of long-acting stim-
ulants in 2003), since the use of stimulants is considered first-line treatment for ADHD.
This trend may also be associated with the increased availability of mental health training
for primary care practitioners and practice guidelines supporting the successful manage-
ment of ADHD in primary care [ 30 , 31 ]. Consistentwith this possibility, findings from
one study reviewed here found a shift across time and provinces away from ADHD di-
agnosis, primarily from specialists to general practitioners [ 15 ]. Thisshift also coincides
with practitioner-reported improvements in comfort and willingness to diagnose and treat
ADHD in primary care [ 11 , 12 , 17 , 18 , 31 ]. Whilecombined medication and psychosocial
treatment is recognized as an important treatment approach for ADHD, the insufficient
availability of specialty care resources and publicly-funded psychosocial treatments in
Canada limits treatment options, which may point to an important gap in equitable ADHD
care access in Canada [ 11 ]. More data are needed on diagnosis and treatment trends over
time, across Canadian provinces, territories and regions, to inform future efforts regarding
training practitioners and ensuring access to services [29,31].

**5. Conclusions**

The prevalence of ADHD in Canada based on studies published in the past 10 years
varies depending on age group, gender, location and methodological approach.
Future Canadian ADHD prevalence and incidence research would benefit from:

- Overall estimates across provinces and territories.
- Estimates moderated by age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location (e.g., province/territory
    and urban vs. rural), socioeconomic status and access to mental health care insurance.
- Standardized methods for defining ADHD cases, particularly with regard to diag-
    nostic criteria (e.g., DSM and ICD) and data sources (e.g., record of a diagnosis by a
    health professional)
- ADHD case identification using a validated algorithm based on pre-established criteria
    (currently considered best practice for case determination when using large primary
    care datasets) [12].
- Incidence estimates tracked with demographic data.
