**Objective:** To describe adolescent outcomes of childhood attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a diverse community sample. **Method:** ADHD screening of a school district sample of 1,615 students aged 5 to 11 years was followed by a case-control study 8 years later. High-risk youths meeting full (n = 94) and subthreshold (n = 75) DSM-IV ADHD criteria were matched with demographically similar low-risk peers (n = 163). Outcomes domains included symptom, functional impairment, quality of life, substance use, educational outcomes, and juvenile justice involvement. **Results:** In all, 44% of youths with childhood ADHD had not experienced remission. Compared with unaffected peers, adolescents with childhood ADHD were more likely to display oppositional defiant disorder (odds ratio [OR] = 12.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6-30.0), anxiety/depression (OR = 10.3, 95% CI 2.7-39.3), significant functional impairment (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.9), reduced quality of life (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.3-4.7), and involvement with the juvenile justice system (OR = 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9.1). Subthreshold ADHD, but not full ADHD, increased the risk of grade retention, whereas both conditions increased the risk of graduation failure. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), but not childhood ADHD, increased the risk of cannabis and alcohol use. None of the adolescent outcomes of childhood ADHD were moderated by gender, race or poverty. **Conclusions:** ADHD heralds persistence of ADHD and comorbid symptoms into adolescence, as well as significant risks for functional impairment and juvenile justice involvement. Subthreshold ADHD symptoms typically do not qualify affected students for special educational interventions, yet increase the risk for adverse educational outcomes. Findings stress the importance of early ADHD recognition, especially its comorbid presentation with ODD, for prevention and intervention strategies. J. Am. Acad. Child Adolesc.

Early observational studies of the develop- mental course and of adolescent or adult outcomes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) suggested frequent symptom persistence into adulthood, and dysfunctional outcomes in the domains of psychological adjust- ment, interpersonal relationships, and work per- formance. A recent international investigation by Lara et al.,based on the World Health Organization World Mental Health Survey, re- ported that half of the cases of childhood ADHD persisted into adulthood and that persistence was highest for the attentional plus impulsive- hyperactive type. The presence of ADHD symp- toms is associated with concurrent significant functional impairment in home, school, and peer domains. Thus, it is not surprising that a recent review by Danckaerts et al. concluded that ADHD has a significant negative impact on qual- ity of life comparable to that of other mental disorders and severe physical disorders, particu- larly as reported from the perspective of parents. ADHD has been linked to increased risk for substance use disorders (SUD). Molina et al. propose that a childhood ADHD diagnosis is as strong a risk factor for substance use and abuse as a positive SUD family history, and that the risk cuts across alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs. Previous studies have re- vealed conflicting findings regarding the risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD) outcomes among children with ADHD, but have established that patients with ADHD are more likely to initiate cigarette smoking, appear at higher risk for the development of nicotine dependence, and may have more difficulty with smoking cessation.

ADHD is associated with poor grades, low- ered reading and math standardized test scores, higher grade retention, and increased rates of detention and expulsion, which eventually result in lower rates of high school graduation and postsecondary education.Longitudinal studies indicate that students with ADHD tend to achieve at lower levels than would be predicted based on intellectual ability. The importance of considering learning disabilities in ADHD out- come studies is emphasized by Faraone et al., who reported that among children with ADHD, those with comorbid learning disabilities (LD) at baseline had higher rates of grade retention, in-school tutoring, and placement in special ed- ucation classes at follow-up.

Furthermore, studies spanning several de- cades have found that ADHD is associated with increased rates of delinquency and arrest. More recently, the Multisite Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD examined a range of symptom and outcome variables in a cohort diagnosed with ADHD as well as a local norma- tive comparison group and reported higher rates of police contact and arrests among cohort mem- bers with ADHD.

Our study seeks to address gaps in current knowledge by providing naturalistic ADHD out- come data from an epidemiologically derived diverse school district sample followed over an 8-year period. The study expands on previous research because the sample is not restricted to particular ADHD subtypes, includes a large number of females and African American youth, and a prospectively identified matched local <a name="assessment instruments"></a><a name="predictor measures"></a>comparison group. We provide observational outcome data in the following domains: psycho- pathology; functioning and quality of life; rates of smoking, alcohol, and substance use; educa- tional outcomes, including achievement, grade point averages, special education service use, graduation rates, and grade retentions; and in- volvement with the juvenile justice system. Fur- thermore, this study also examines whether the relationship between adolescent outcomes and ADHD status differs by gender, race, or poverty, by examining moderation effects.

**METHOD**
Participants and Procedures

This research uses observational data from the study ‚ÄúADHD: Detection and Service Use.‚ÄùA random sample of children, oversampling girls by a factor of 2, was derived from public school records of 12,009 children from kindergarten through fifth grade from a North Florida school district. Of 1,615 children screened, 29.5% (n = 476) were identified as high risk for ADHD because they were either already diagnosed or treated for ADHD, were suspected by a parent or school of having ADHD, or elicited parent or school concern about behavior problems and parent scores of the Swanson-Nolan-and Pelham-IV (SNAP-IV), a stan- dardized ADHD screening measure, were elevated 1\.5 standard deviations above the norm. As shown in [Figure 1], between 1998 and 2008, a cohort of high-risk children participated in four subsequent waves of data collection (66% participation rate) before completing a Wave 6 outcomes assessment, and a matched sample of low-risk children participated in the outcomes as- sessment. Among all high-risk participants, 274 were found to be eligible to participate in Wave 6. Of those children, 169 participated (62%), 12 declined (4%), and 93 could not be contacted (34%). Nonparticipants did not differ from participants by race, but were more likely to include females than males (44% vs. 29%, chi-square (1 df) 6.153, *p* = .013) and poor children than nonpoor peers (46% vs. 30%, chi-square [1 df] 7\.435, *p* = .0064). For Wave 6, 163 peers classified as low risk in Wave 1 were matched with high-risk participants by gender, race, poverty status and age to serve as the outcome comparison group. The total sample of 332 Wave 6 study participants were, on average, 17 years old (range 14 to 21 years, SD = 1.4); they included 120 (36%) African Americans, and 167 (50%) received lunch subsidies, an indicator of pov- erty. Of the 187 (56%) female participants, 92 were in the high-risk group and 95 were in the comparison group. Separate personal interviews were conducted by trained research assistants with parents and adoles- cents in homes, in community locations, or at our research center. The study was approved by the Uni- versity Institutional Review Board and the school district research office. Informed consent (from parents and young adults) or child assent (from adolescents) were obtained from all subjects, who received a sti- pend of $40 (parents) or $30 (adolescents) for their participation.

Assessment Instruments

*Predictor Measures.* Sociodemographic information about child age, gender, race, and poverty status was obtained from school registration records and verified during interviews.

DSM-IV diagnoses were assigned based on parental interviews conducted by trained graduate research assistants in clinical or educational psychology with documented reliability using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children, Version 4.0 (DISC-4), adminis- tered at Wave 2 and the Kiddie-SADS-Present and

Lifetime Version (K-SADS PL), administered at Waves 4 or 6. The diagnostic assessment for the low-risk group was conducted at Wave 6, concurrently with the outcome assessment. We chose the semi-structured K-SADS-PL for Wave 6 because we considered it more sensitive than the DISC-IV to ascertain lifetime preva- lence for ADHD, a condition that may have been outgrown by late adolescence. We constructed an ADHD variable distinguishing three groups, high-risk adolescents meeting full (n = 94) or subthreshold (n = 75) DSM-IV criteria for ADHD diagnosis, and the local low-risk comparison group (n = 163) without ADHD. <a name="alcohol and substance use"></a>The diagnostic assignments are supported by the find- ing that mean (SD) of inattention/hyperactivity teacher SNAP-IV scores at Wave 1 differed signifi- <a name="outcome measures"></a>cantly (*p*<.0001) among these three groups (1.4[0.89]/ 1\.0 [0.81]; 1.2[0.92]/0.8[0.76]; and 0.3[0.47]/0.2[0.41], respectively).

**Outcome Measures**

*Psychopathology.* The Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale (VADPRS) was used at Wave 6 to assess symptoms of ADHD, oppositional defiant dis- order (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), anxiety, and depression. The reliability, factor structure, and con- current validity have been found to be acceptable and consistent with the DSM-IV and other accepted mea- sures of ADHD. VADPRS screens are positive for combined subtype of ADHD if at least six inattentive and six hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were en- dorsed as 2 (often) or 3 (very often) and performance was rated as 4 (somewhat of a problem) or 5 (prob- lematic) in at least one home, school, or social setting; inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive subtypes are constructed commensurately, and we constructed a subclinical ADHD outcome variable if four or five instead of six symptoms were endorsed. In similar fashion, a positive ODD screen required at least four of eight ODD symptoms rated as occurring often or very often, a CD screen three of 14 CD symptoms, and the combined anxiety/depression screen three of seven respective symptoms.

Adolescents completed the Self-Report of Personal- ity of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC SRP), an instrument with established psycho- metric characteristics that yields three composite sub- scores, School Maladjustment, Clinical Maladjustment, Personal Adjustment, and an overall summary score, the Emotional Symptom Index (ESI); t scores greater than 70 are considered clinically relevant. *Functioning and Quality of Life.* To assess child functional impairment, parents and adolescents com- pleted the Columbia Impairment Scale (CIS), a mea- sure with acceptable psychometric characteristics. CIS scores above 14 are considered clinically relevant; parent and adolescent responses were combined so that scores above 14 by one or both respondents were classified as functional impairment.

To assess quality of life, parents completed the 28-item version of the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), which has been found to be reliable, valid, and responsive to changes in ADHD symptoms, support- ing its use as an outcome measure for ADHD popula- tions. The CHQ yields summary scores for physical and emotional/behavioral health, with higher scores indicating better quality of life. Scores below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile for the US population provided in the User‚Äôs Manual (page 340) were classified as low quality of life.

Adolescents completed the Youth Quality of Life (YQOL) questionnaire.The 13-item survey version (YQOL-S) contains five contextual items and eight perceptual items. YQOL scales have shown to be reliable and valid. Scores below the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile for our sample were classified as low quality of life. *Alcohol and Substance Use.* Adolescents completed 33 items from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey that assess tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Parents reported on adolescent risk behavior by completing five items adapted from the Pride Questionnaire for Parents regarding tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Parent and adolescent answers were combined so that endorse- ments by one or both respondents were classified as positive use response. We did not obtain laboratory confirmation and may therefore have underestimated actual use.

*Educational Outcomes.* Florida Comprehensive Achieve- ment Test (FCAT) Norm Referenced Test (NRT) scores based on the Stanford Test of Achievement (SAT-10) scores, grade point averages (GPA), and information about retentions, graduation, and receipt of special education services were obtained with written paren- tal permission from school records. This study used FCAT NRT achievement scores for reading and math- ematics and unweighted cumulative high school GPA

Scores. Graduation rate was calculated according to the formula used by the Florida Department of Edu- cation as the percentage of graduation eligible students (n = 136) who actually graduated. Receipt of special education services included all services rendered un- der the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Services under the category of LD were also included. For this study, we used the school LD designation as a proxy for learning disability preva- lence, with the understanding that this approach un- deridentifies true cases of learning disabilities.

*Mental Health Service Use, ADHD Medications, and Involvement with Juvenile Justice.* To assess use of services, including those rendered through the juve- nile justice setting, parents completed the Child and Adolescent Services Assessment (CASA), which identifies mental health treatment in inpatient and outpatient settings and includes inquiry about medi- cation use. Medication information obtained in up to six waves of data collection was integrated to identify use of stimulant medication, ADHD medications (stimulants, atomoxetine, alpha agonists, bupropion if used for ADHD, tricyclic antidepressants if used for ADHD), and ‚Äúother‚Äù psychotropic medications (atypical antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake inhib- itors, mood stabilizers, other). Involvement with the juvenile justice system was identified through parent <a name="statistical analyses"></a>reports on the CASA, distinguishing residential stay in detention from outpatient involvement with a proba- tion officer or juvenile corrections counselor.

**Statistical Analyses**

The independent variable was childhood ADHD status, consisting of three subgroups (1 = childhood ADHD, 2 = childhood subthreshold ADHD, 3 = non-ADHD comparison group) and allowing for three contrasts (1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3). Chi- square, Fisher‚Äôs exact test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to examine differences in relationship between ADHD risk group status and our 35 outcome variables, grouped into four domains. Level of significance was set at 0.05; all tests were two-tailed. For significant Pearson chi-square or ANOVA findings, we conducted 2√ó2 chi-square tests or Tukey‚Äôs post hoc comparisons, respectively, for each subgroup contrast. We used a Bonferroni correction (i.e., the level of significance was set at 0.017, 0.05 divided by three comparisons) for the multiple comparisons tests made using 2√ó2 chi-square tests. We used Tukey‚Äôs multiple comparisons procedure since the simultaneous Type I error rate is less than 0.05 when group sample sizes are unequal.

To establish effect sizes we calculated Cohen‚Äôs d for continuous variables and odds ratios for categorical variables. For all outcome variables multiple logistic regression was used to determine independent predic- <a name="mental health services use"></a>tion by ADHD risk group status, controlling for the sociodemographic characteristics age, gender, race, and poverty. For nonpsychopathology outcomes, the full prediction model also controlled for ODD and depression/anxiety comorbidities ascertained at Wave 6\. Therefore, these analyses also provided estimates of the independent contribution of ODD and anxiety/ depression to the outcomes in question. Furthermore, because the relationship between ADHD and two school outcomes, grade retention and failure to grad- uate, may be confounded by comorbid learning dis- abilities we ran two additional analyses, adding LD classification as a covariate to the full prediction <a name="results"></a>model. Moderation of outcomes by gender, race and <a name="bivariate group outcome comparisons"></a>poverty was tested by including interaction term in prediction models.


**RESULTS**
Bivariate Group Outcome Comparisons

Details of group comparisons for all domains at provided in [Table 1]. At the final study wave, significantly (*p* < .0001) more youth with child- hood ADHD scored positive for ADHD on the VADPRS (44%, n = 41) than those who had only subthreshold symptoms in childhood (15%, n = 11) or were in the comparison group (2%, n = 4). For all other parent-reported (prevalence of ODD, CD, anxiety/depression) and adolescent outcomes (BASC-SRP t-scores) youth with child- hood ADHD had significantly higher propor- tions and means than peers who exhibited only subthreshold symptoms or no ADHD in child- hood; the latter two groups did not differ from each other.

Parents and adolescents reported more func- tional impairment and lower quality of life for youth with childhood ADHD than peers with subthreshold or no ADHD. However, use of cigarettes, cannabis, or alcohol did not differ by childhood ADHD status.

Adolescents with childhood ADHD and sub- threshold ADHD differed from unaffected peers in all educational outcomes, showing a higher likelihood of receiving services for learning dis- abilities, to be retained, and to experience grad- uation failure. As detailed in [Table 1], childhood ADHD and subthreshold ADHD were associated with lower standardized achievement scores in reading and mathematics compared with scores among students without ADHD, as well as with lower grade point averages. Similarly, adoles- cents with childhood ADHD or subthreshold ADHD were significantly more likely to have poor outcomes in the juvenile justice domain than peers without ADHD, as indicated by higher rates of detention sentences or probation officer involvement.

**Mental Health Services Use**

Adolescents with childhood ADHD were more likely than peers with subthreshold ADHD and unaffected peers to have ever received inpatient (19% vs. 11% and 2%, respectively; *p* < .0001) or outpatient mental health treatment (68% vs. 44% and 23%; *p* < .0001). One-half of adolescents with childhood ADHD had ever been treated with ADHD medications (n = 47; 50%), mostly stim- ulant preparations (n = 43; 46%); and one-fifth (n = 21; 22%) had received other psychotropic medications. None of the unaffected peers ever received ADHD medications and only 2 (1%) received other psychotropic medications. One- quarter of adolescents with subthreshold ADHD reported being medicated for ADHD (n = 18; 24%), including with stimulants (n = 15; 20%), and 11% (n = 8) had received other psychotropic medications.

As shown in detail in [Table 2], childhood ADHD and subthreshold childhood ADHD symptoms increased the odds of adolescent ADHD presen- tations. Relative to the unaffected comparison group, participants with childhood ADHD, but not with subthreshold ADHD, had significantly increased odds of ODD and depression/anxiety. Females had higher odds of anxiety/depression than males (odds raio [OR] = 5.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-19.5).

Childhood ADHD, but not subthreshold ADHD, and the presence of adolescence ODD increased the odds of poor functioning and re- duced quality of life. Of the sociodemographic covariates, only age had a significant relation- ships, with increasing age raising the odds of poor quality of life.

ADHD risk status did not predict any of the risk outcomes. Increasing age raised the odds of all substance/alcohol risk behaviors. Female partici- pants had lower odds of cannabis use (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), and African American back- ground reduced the odds of all substance/alcohol <a name="psychopathology"></a>risk behaviors. Poverty increased the odds of ciga- rette use. Adolescent ODD symptoms more than tripled the odds of cannabis and alcohol use.

Childhood ADHD and subthreshold ADHD increased the odds of graduation failure, and subthreshold ADHD increased the odds of grade retention. These relationships continued after ad- justing for potential confounding by learning disabilities. Increasing age and poverty, but not gender or race, raised the odds of grade retention and graduation failure. ODD significantly in- creased the odds of grade retention but not of graduation failure.

Childhood ADHD and childhood subthreshold <a name="gender, race, and poverty as adolescent "></a>ADHD tripled the odds of juvenile justice involve- ment. Juvenile justice involvement did not vary by age, gender, or race, but the odds increased for children in poverty and for those with ODD.

Gender, Race, and Poverty as Adolescent ADHD Outcome Moderators

Gender, race, and poverty were not found to mod- erate adolescent ADHD outcomes; the interaction effects of gender, race, and poverty with ADHD risk status were not statistically significant.

**DISCUSSION**
Our study results from a diverse community sam- ple replicate findings of pervasive differences in adolescent psychopathology, functioning, and risk profiles between children with childhood ADHD and a local normal comparison group reported in other longitudinal studies. Our outcome find- ings expand on previous observational studies be- cause we included youth of all ADHD subtypes and had sufficient participant diversity to allow an examination of potential moderating effects of gen- der, race, and poverty on various outcomes. How- ever, findings have to be considered in the context of several study limitations. Although representa- tive of the school district, our sample is a regional sample and our findings, especially those related to race and sociodemographic variables, may not generalize to other geographic areas. Our com- parison group, although prospectively identified as low ADHD risk at study baseline, underwent the childhood ADHD diagnostic assessment ret- rospectively, at the point of outcome assessment. Moreover, analyses did not control for baseline comorbidities; retention rates were moderate, re- sulting in sample sizes that may have been insuf- ficient to detect interaction effects; and multiple tests of hypotheses were conducted which in- crease the chance of spurious findings. Also, approximately 20% of study participants were younger than 16 years at follow-up and may not have manifested certain outcomes yet.

Psychopathology

In line with other studies that reported ADHD persistence rates into late adolescence/early adult- hood ranging between 26% and 46%, more than 40% of youth with childhood ADHD still met ADHD criteria by age 16 in our cohort, confirm- ing that a considerable proportion of childhood ADHD persists into adolescence. The current study replicated findings that childhood ADHD is associated with elevated rates of adolescent disruptive and internalizing disorders. Of note, adolescents with childhood ADHD in our study portrayed themselves as well-adjusted in their daily lives, including in the school environ- ment, consistent with other reports of overly positive self-perceptions and positive illusory bias in adolescents with ADHD. Other longitu- dinal studies examining psychiatric outcomes of childhood ADHD reported that ADHD was pre- dictive of ODD, and that comorbid ODD at baseline was associated with increased risk for ODD, conduct disorder, major depression, and bipolar disorder at follow-up. Our findings of increased rates of depression/anxiety are commensurate to findings from other studies. These findings, however, do not imply that ADHD and depression are epiphenomenal or that ADHD causes ODD. Past studies investigating these asso- ciations have found that the relationship between <a name="functioning/quality of life"></a>ADHD and depression and ODD may be mediated by several factors, including parent behavior man- agement and locus of control, ADHD subtype, and family environment factors.

**Functioning/Quality of Life**

Our findings are consistent with other studies re- porting that childhood ADHD is associated with significant functional impairment. It is noteworthy that our adolescents with ADHD acknowledged <a name="juvenile justice involvement"></a>high rates of functional impairments, even though their psychopathology self-reports placed them in the normative range. Possible explanations for this discrepancy may be adolescents‚Äô sense of stigma associated with acknowledging psychiatric symp- toms, and their shifting perspectives on their own illness career related to ADHD. If confirmed in other studies, our finding may support efforts to obtain adolescent functioning ratings as part of response monitoring in clinical ADHD care. More focused integration of functional assessment dur- <a name="risk behaviors"></a>ing ADHD treatment may bring in valuable adolescent perspectives, which in turn may help to improve subsequent treatment adherence and outcomes.

**Risk Behaviors**

Our study found no association between child- hood ADHD and adolescent use of cigarettes or cannabis. These findings contrast with studies that have reported higher rates of substance use and cigarette use. However, our age-specific findings are consistent with results reported by Molina et al., and observed lowered odds of <a name="mental health service use"></a>alcohol use among those with childhood ADHD have also been reported by Flory et al. Consis- tent with our findings, August et al. have re- ported increased risk of smoking, cannabis, and alcohol use associated with ODD. Hypotheses <a name="adverse educational outcomes"></a>have been advanced that oppositional defiant behaviors result in peer rejection and thus con- tribute toward deviant peer relationships and escalating problem behaviors via social reinforce- ment and modeling by poor role models.

**Adverse Educational Outcomes**

Whereas childhood ADHD, but not subthreshold ADHD symptomatology, predicted poor functioning and lowered quality-of-life outcomes, both ADHD groups had poorer educational outcomes compared with unaffected peers, with effects sizes for reading and mathematics scores comparable to those reported in other studies. Interestingly, graduation rates were lowest for our subthreshold ADHD group, which may reflect lack of special educational supports for students who do not qual- ify for special school services absent of a full ADHD diagnosis. In a recent study conducted in Puerto Rico, Bauermeister et al. found that students with ADHD had more suspensions, but not more grade failure, than nonaffected peers, and suggested that ADHD may protect against grade failure because students with ADHD qualify for more services. Our findings on the role of comorbid learning disabilities are consistent with other reports sug- gesting that LD predicts further impaired academic outcomes for children with ADHD.

**Juvenile Justice Involvement**

Childhood ADHD and subthreshold ADHD status independently predicted involvement with the ju- venile justice system, tripling the odds of this undesirable and costly societal outcome. Our findings of an association of ADHD and legal involvement are similar to those reported in other longitudinal studies. In our sample, poverty independently tripled the odds of juvenile justice involvement. Poverty and delinquency have been shown to be related in large-scale national US studies as well. Interestingly, our study found no significant differences by gender or race/ethnicity for juvenile justice involvement. This is surprising, because it is generally well accepted that involve- ment in the juvenile justice system is more common for boys and African Americans. However, the number of girls involved in the juvenile justice system has been reportedly climbing at a rapid rate, and a recent article by Tracy et al. reports that female and male juvenile delinquents are now more similar than they are different with respect to arrest rates.

**Mental Health Service Use**

Treatment data for this cohort showed that one-half of those with childhood ADHD and one-quarter of those with subthreshold symptoms had ever re- ceived any ADHD medications by late adolescence. These findings are consistent with reports of possi- ble ADHD undertreatment coexisting with medi- cation use in the absence of a full ADHD diagnosis. Our findings are also comparable to MTA reports of 59% ADHD medication use by the com- munity care group at the 3-year follow-up. Rates of lifetime psychiatric hospitalizations in our ADHD risk group were higher than in the nonaf- <a name="gender, race, and poverty effects"></a>fected comparison group, consistent with studies finding higher inpatient and outpatient service utili- zation and medical cost for those with ADHD.

**Gender, Race, and Poverty Effects**

Our study did not find any interaction effects of gender, race and poverty with childhood ADHD status on adolescent ADHD outcomes. However, as expected, sociodemographic characteristics by themselves did emerge as independent predic- tors of certain outcomes. Similar to other stud- ies,we found that females were more likely to experience anxiety and depression. Our study also found that African-Americans were far less likely to engage in smoking, cannabis, and alco- hol use than were their white counterparts. This finding is in line with a recent study by Watt and Rogers that indicates that African American youth are significantly less likely to use alcohol than white youth irrespective of gender. The authors speculate that factors such as African American youth having less disposable income and higher religious involvement than their white counterparts as possible explanations.

Poverty, as documented in other studies, increased the risks for adverse adolescent educa- tional and juvenile justice outcomes. Poverty disadvantages children in multiple domains, in- cluding prenatal stressors, nutrition, housing, education, and access to health care. In particular, children from disadvantaged SES backgrounds tend to experience higher levels of toxic stress and have been shown to display heightened activation of stress-responsive systems, which may result in lasting alterations of subsequent disease risk.

In summary, our findings replicate findings that childhood ADHD heralds significant risks for symptom persistence, development of depression, functional impairment, lower educational achieve- ment, and juvenile justice involvement in late ado- lescence. Findings furthermore stress the impor- tance of early recognition of childhood ADHD and its subthreshold presentations, especially when co- morbid with ODD, for prevention and intervention strategies. Future research is needed to determine whether ADHD plus ODD represent a distinct subtype and to develop interventions that yield long-term improvement not only in ADHD symp- tomatology but also in relevant functional do- mains, especially educational outcomes and legal system involvement, outcomes of particular rele- vance to families and society as a whole.
