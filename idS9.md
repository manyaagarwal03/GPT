**Abstract** The purpose of this study was to examine the rela- tionships between ADHD symptoms and impairment within a sample that includes children in early childhood (*n* =250), middle childhood (*n*=269) and adolescence (i.e., high school; *n*=269). Nested multivariate regression analyses were used to examine the extent to which each ADHD symptom dimension (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) is most associated with impairment in academic, social, and behavioral function- ing within and across three developmental levels. Results in- dicated for academic impairment, inattention is more predic- tive than hyperactivity/impulsivity at all ages. For social func- tioning, both with peers and teachers, hyperactivity/ impulsivity is more predictive than inattention but only for early childhood students; at the high school level, inattention is a significant predictor of social impairment. For behavioral functioning in the classroom, the pattern is mixed across di- mensions and ages with HI decreasing in predictive utility across the three age groups and IA increasing in predictive utility. Forward stepwise regression was used to determine which of the 18 ADHD symptom items are most associated with impairment within and across developmental levels. Findings indicate that the symptoms that were most predictive of impairment varied by age group and by domain of impair- ment. Implications for assessment are discussed.

The current diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hy- peractivity disorder (ADHD) require the presence of developmentally-inappropriate levels of inattention (IA) and/or hyperactivity/ impulsivity (HI), and symptom- related impairment . Given that there was no criterion for im- pairment until the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual , historically, greater attention has focused on the role of symptoms rather than impairment in the diagnosis. However, symptom importance (as evidenced by retention in diag- nostic criteria) has largely been defined by high statis- tical factor loadings on an ADHD symptom dimension or strong utility in predicting a symptom threshold (; . Thus, symptoms that are highly correlated with other symptoms have been identified without evidence that they are associated with impairment, which may limit their diagnostic effi- ciency. Indeed, research conducted in normative com- munity samples indicates that many people meet the ADHD symptom criteria but are not impaired  This is an important distinction, as impairment in functioning, rath- er than symptoms, is often the primary reason that a child is referred for services . Further, improved functioning, rather than symptom re- duction, has become a recommended target for interven- tion, given the relevance to consumers and later adjust- ment . The goal of the current study is to examine the relations between teacher-rated symptoms and impairment in early child- hood, middle childhood and adolescence to determine which symptoms are most associated with domain- specific impairment at each age in a normative population.


**Variation in the Expression of Symptoms and Impairment across Development**

Although the same symptoms have been used to diagnose ADHD in persons of various ages, symptom manifestation varies across development. For example, in young children leaving seat when sitting is expected, runs or climbs excessively, and blurting out answers are common classroom manifestations of HI. In contrast, for adolescents, runs or climbs excessively occurs infrequently and independent movement from one’s seat is often develop- mentally appropriate. Instead, HI in adolescence may manifest through impulsive decision-making in risky situations such as when driving, experimenting with substances, spending money, or engaging in intimate relationships. Indeed, in normative datasets, teachers consistently report fewer traditional HI symptoms in older youth than in younger youth, whereas rates of IA symptom endorsement remain consistent across ages. Despite this apparent reduction in traditional HI symptoms, impairment persists and may even get worse dur- ing adolescence . Together, these data demonstrate that the manifestations of ADHD symptoms change with age, and that adult reports of HI symptoms decline through adolescence, despite some evidence that impairment may in- crease. These developmental trends receive greater attention in DSM-5  than DSM-IV; yet, systematic exploration of the relationship between symptoms and impair- ment across development would offer empirical support for the utility of existing symptom descriptions and inform modifica- tions to more developmentally-appropriate descriptions.

Although some forms of impairment may remain consistent across developmental periods (e.g., disorganization, parent-child conflict), there is evidence that new forms of impairment emerge as expectations for autonomy from adults increase, new domains are encountered (e.g., dating, employment, driving), and oppor- tunities for risky behaviors increase. Given that symptoms and im- pairment change over the course of development, the symptoms that produce such impairment may change as well. For example, for young children, leaves seat and difficulty awaiting a turn may be most disruptive to peer and student-teacher relationships because remaining in seat is expected and turn-taking is an im- portant milestone in elementary school. However, for adoles- cents, these symptoms may be less problematic in a high school context and less related to social impairment. Thus, in addition to understanding how symptoms and impairment change across development, knowing how the relationship between symptoms and impairment changes could stimulate new approaches to assessment and screening. Namely, evidence could be used to (a) determine which symptom descriptions should be modified to be more developmentally-appropriate to early childhood, middle childhood, adolescence, and adulthood; (b) develop new screening instruments; and (c) explore differential weighting of symptoms to enhance diagnostic efficiency.


**Relationship Between Impairment and ADHD Symptom Dimensions**

Studies examining the relationship between impairment and ADHD subtype demonstrate some symptom-impairment specificity. The patterns generally suggest that children with the IA sub- type are more likely to experience academic impairment (e.g., learning disabilities, problems with school work), whereas children with the Combined (CB) subtype are more likely to experience behavioral impairment such as problems with peers, opposition and conduct problems;  and that this rela- tionship may remain throughout childhood and into young adulthood ; . Others have demonstrated predictive validity for the inatten- tive subtype of ADHD, as children who met symptom criteria for the ADHD-IA subtype exhibited lower achievement scores over 8 years than those without ADHD or who met symptom criteria for another subtype . Further, in a normative sample of children from Spain, confir- matory factor analysis indicated that the factor variances in the school setting for IA symptoms where higher than that those for HI symptoms . We expect to replicate this overall pattern in the current study; namely, we hypothe- sized that IA symptoms will be more related than HI symp- toms to academic impairment. We also seek to expand the exploration of the relation between symptoms and impairment to the social and behavioral domains of functioning, as the findings are more mixed for these domains than those for the academic domain and may change with age. For example, for young children, there is some evidence that teacher-rated HI is more associated with disruptive and aggressive behavior and social problems than is IA (e.g., )). However, more recent evidence from a short-term longitudi- nal study with a community sample of fourth, fifth, and sixth graders suggests that parent-rated IA, but not HI, was associ- ated with lower peer acceptance and fewer dyadic friendships . Further, in adolescence and adulthood, HI may be related to negative outcomes associated with risky behaviors (e.g., arrests, car accidents) . Although speculative, the stronger association with HI may be largely accounted for by symptoms of impulsivity rather than traditional symptoms of hyperactivity. These patterns guided our hypotheses; however, three factors constrain our confi- dence in these patterns. First, these studies did not examine the symptom-impairment relationship across early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence. Second, the disparate measures of impairment used with the younger and older sam- ples may obscure patterns across development. Third, the re- lationships between individual symptoms and impairment were not examined.

**Relationship Between Impairment and Individual ADHD Symptoms**

To our knowledge, there is only one study that has examined the relationship between individual ADHD symptoms and impairment. Mota and Schachar  attempted to identify parent- and teacher-rated symptoms and symptom clusters that best predicted global impairment in a school-based sample of children aged 7 to 12. Their findings confirm that each symptom is not equally predictive of overall impairment; teacher-rated leaves seat, and parent-rated blurts out were the individual symp- toms that best discriminated impaired from non-impaired chil- dren. Their findings also highlight the importance of examining parent and teacher data separately. This may be particularly im- portant at the secondary school level. Although online systems and email communications may enhance parents’ knowledge of child academic and behavioral functioning during secondary school, parental involvement in adolescents’ educational activi- ties often decreases during this time. Thus teachers have more up-to-date information about adolescents day-to-day academic functioning, as well as a normative comparison group. Further, the symptom algorithm that best discriminated impaired from non-impaired children was comprised of six IA symptoms (sustaining atten- tion, avoiding tasks, forgetful, does not listen, does not follow through, difficulty organizing) and only two HI symptoms (blurts out and talks excessively). This suggests that it is important to examine the relationships between clusters of symptoms and impairment, as well as the relationships between individual symptoms and impairment. This study advances our understand- ing of the relationship between individual symptoms and impair- ment; however, age differences within the sample were not ex- amined and the authors used a global measure of impairment that did not allow for examination of the relationship between symp- toms and individual domains of impairment. Our study addresses these limitations, and those of other studies by including com- munity samples in early childhood (Kindergarten sample), mid- dle childhood (third, fourth, and fifth grade sample), and adoles- cence (high school sample), using a single measure of impair- ment with all ages, assessing multiple domains of impairment, and examining the symptom-impairment relationship using both symptom dimensions and individual symptoms. Because school- based screenings or assessments are typically based on teacher report and because teachers have the benefit of a normative com- parison group when making ratings, we chose to focus on teacher ratings of symptoms and impairment.

**Aims and Hypotheses**

Our aims are (1) to determine which of the two symptoms di- mensions (i.e., IA and HI) is most associated with impairment in academic, social, and behavioral functioning within and across three developmental time points, and (2) to determine which of the 18 ADHD symptom descriptions are most associated with such impairment within and across these three developmental time points. With regard to Aim 1, for academic functioning, we hypothesized a replication of previous studies; IA would be more associated than HI at all three developmental stages. For social and behavioral functioning, we predicted that HI would be more associated than IA in early and middle childhood . However, for adolescence, the data are too mixed to make a directional prediction.  study sug- gests that IA and HI will be similarly predictive of social and behavioral functioning during high school. In contrast, Gordon et al. analyses of the adult sample suggest that HI would be more predictive than IA depending on the outcomes assessed (e.g., arrests, driving accidents). Given that our indices of func- tioning are based on teacher ratings rather than objective out- comes such as arrests and driving accidents, we may not find this increased association between HI and social and behavioral impairment. Further, because there is evidence that the frequen- cy of traditional HI symptoms declines in adolescence  and that these symptoms have limited relationships with outcomes in adolescence we may observe no relationship between HI and impair- ment in the high school sample. If this is the case, it may confirm that current symptom descriptions of IA are more applicable across development than are the current symptom descriptions of HI. As noted earlier, the impulsive nature of some of the impairment associated with adolescents may be uniquely asso- ciated with the three impulsivity items and not the hyperactivity symptoms. Thus, in exploratory analyses, we examined the re- lationship between the hyperactivity items and impulsivity items with impairment separately to consider these issues. With regard to Aim 2, there is insufficient evidence upon which to base hypotheses. Thus, specific predictions were not made.

Sample 1: *Early Childhood* Ratings of 251 Kindergarteners were provided by 12 teachers from five schools in one school district in a rural community . This sample represents 85 % of all students in the district’s 2011 Kindergarten cohort. One child was removed from the sample due to incomplete data resulting in a sample of 250 for the current study. Children in the sample ranged in age from 4 to 6 (*M* =4.86; *SD*=0.41); 94.4 % were Caucasian and 50.8 % were male. Teacher consent rate was 100 %; all were Caucasian females. In this sample, 14.8 % had clinically- significant impairment; and 11 % of this sample had clinically signif- icant symptoms in one or both ADHD symptom dimensions (81.48 % of whom also demonstrated impairment).

Sample 2: *Middle Childhood* Parent consent was obtained for 305 students in grades 3, 4 and 5 (55.7 % consent rate) in one school district (a different school district than Sample 1) . Thirty-six participants were removed from the study due to incomplete data (*N*=24), lack of child assent to participate (*N*=10), or families moving to a different school district (*N*=2). Ratings of 269 students were provided by 29 teachers from four schools. The teacher consent rate was 100 %. All teachers were Caucasian and 90 % were female. Children ranged in age from 8 to 12 (*M*=9.60; *SD*=0.96); 93\.5 % were Caucasian and 50.2 % were male. In this sample, 27\.88 % had clinically-significant impairment and 13.38 % had clinically significant symptoms in one or both ADHD symptom dimensions (91.67 % of whom also demonstrated impairment).

Sample 3: Adolescence Ratings of 875 students were provid- ed by teachers (*N*=143) from 19 schools in four states . The teacher consent rate was 32.64 %. Following listwise deletion, data from 137 teachers regarding 786 high school students were used. Because sample size influences the statistical significance of findings, we chose to make the high school sample equivalent in size to other two samples to avoid interpreting smaller effects from the high school sample than those in the other two samples. To equate the sample size from this study with early and late elementary samples, a random sample of teachers was selected and data from each of the students those teachers rated were included in the current study. This resulted in a sample of 269 students with ratings provided by 46 teachers. Most of the teachers (65.2 %) reported identify- ing as female and 78.2 % were Caucasian. These participants did not differ from the remaining 91 teachers and 517 students on teacher (gender, race, subject taught, special vs. general edu- cation, or years of teaching experience) or student (gender, race) demographic variables. There was a slight difference in the grade distribution of students in subsample and symptoms in one or both ADHD symptom dimensions the remaining stu- dents. Students in this sample were in 9th through 12th grade; 37\.3 % were Caucasian and 48.3 % male. In this sample, 32.7 % had clinically-significant impairment and 11.90 % had clinically significant (100 % of whom also demonstrated impairment).

**Measures**

Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) Rating Scale The DBD measures ADHD symptoms as described in DSM-IV and DSM-V . Teachers rated each symptom on a 4- point scale with anchors of *not at all*, *just a little*, *pretty much* and *very much* and a range of 0 to 3. These subscales have strong internal validity (alphas and omegas>0.8) with elemen- tary and high school samples strong convergent validity, as evidenced by significant correlations with observational data, student grade point average, and other ADHD rating scales and are sensitive to change in ADHD treatment studies . Clinically significant symptom presence is defined as having six or more symptoms of either inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity rated as *pretty much* or *very much*.

Impairment Rating Scale (IRS) The teacher version of the IRS assesses teacher perceptions of stu- dent functioning in relationships with peers and teachers, ac- ademic progress, and behavioral functioning in the classroom. For each domain of impairment, teachers respond to a single item indicating how the child’s problems affect each domain (e.g., his or her relationship with other children). Teachers rate each item by marking an BX^ on a line that ranges from 0 *No problem/definitely does not need treatment* to 6 *Extreme problem/definitely needs treatment*. With elementary school samples, the measure has respectable cross-informant reliabil- ity (e.g., correlations above 0.47), convergent and divergent validity with other impairment scales (e.g., correlation of 0.77 between IRS overall impairment and the Children’s Global Assessment Scale). Scores of three or higher are considered clinically significant and have good predictive validity in identifying elementary school-aged children with ADHD di- agnoses. Psychometric properties are similar with high school samples  with a cut-off of three or higher recommended for all scales except for the academic and overall impairment, for which a score of four or higher is considered clinically significant.

**Procedures**

All procedures were approved by university and school re- search boards.

Sample 1: *Early Childhood* Data from Sample 1 were collect- ed in the context of a Kindergarten screening study . Parents were recruited to participate when they registered their child for Kindergarten (between April and August 2011). Teachers completed rating scales in October 2011 to allow them sufficient time to get to know the students. Teachers were compensated with $80 for study participation.

Sample 2: *Middle Childhood* Data from Sample 2 were col- lected in the context of a project assessing the relationship between parent involvement in child education and child aca- demic achievement . Parents of all students in grades three, four, and five at participating schools were asked to consent to the project and teachers of all children whose parents consented completed the measures. Students received $1 for returning the parent packet (regardless of the parental consent decision). Teachers were given $10 for completing the teacher measures. The school administrators also received $100 for participation, as compensation for the administrative activities that the project required.

Sample 3: *Adolescence* Data from Sample 3 were collected as part of a large grant-funded project . Researchers contacted administrators at high schools to invite their participation in the study. Teachers were given an infor- mational letter, on which their signature would indicate con- sent. Each teacher who agreed to participate received a cover letter, a *Student Selection Form,* and six packets containing the study measures. The cover letter provided teachers with information on how to choose students (by selecting the first student on their roster followed by subsequent, consecutive, odd numbered students until three boys and three girls had been chosen), how to complete the measures, and where to return the packets.


**Results**

Analytic Plan

Multivariate regression models were fit in Mplus Version 6.11 to investigate the prediction of impairment by symptom dimensions and individual symptoms. Given the use of normative samples, DBD and IRS scores were positively skewed. Thus, maximum likelihood estimation robust to non- normality was used. The *cluster* command was used to account for individual students nested within teachers.

The first aim was to determine which of the two symptoms dimensions (i.e., IA and HI) is most associated with impair- ment in social, academic, and behavioral functioning within and across three developmental time points. A multivariate regression was conducted for each sample. Predictor variables were the HI and IA factor scores from the DBD, which were entered simultaneously. Factor scores were created by sum- ming the total symptom scores within each dimension. Criterion variables for each model were IRS scores representing social impairment (both peer relationships and student-teacher relationships scores), academic impairment (academic progress scores), and behavioral impairment (class- room functioning scores). To examine the potential unique relationship between impulsivity and impairment, we con- ducted an exploratory multivariate regression with three pre- dictors (IA total score, impulsivity total, and hyperactivity symptom total) with each of the IRS items as criterion variables.

The second aim was to examine which of the 18 ADHD symptoms are most associated with impairment in social, ac- ademic, and behavioral functioning at three developmental time points (early childhood, middle childhood, adolescence). A forward stepwise entry procedure was used to determine the optimal set of predictors based on a significance criterion of *p*<.05 for inclusion. Criterion variables for each model were the four IRS scores previously mentioned. Although this ap- proach has limitations, we chose it because we needed an approach that would allow us to iden- tify the symptoms and symptom domains most associated with impairment from a group of symptoms that were corre- lated with each other. Stepwise regression is well-suited to address this type of question.

**Aim 1**

The regression models had no constraints, and all paths and covariances were estimated. Thus, they were just identified, with no degrees of freedom, and had perfect fit. For each age group, the IA and HI symptom total scores, together, ex- plained a significant proportion of the variance in each of the impairment domains and the *R*<sup>2</sup> for each model was sig- nificant. Standardized betas for IA and HI within each model are presented in Table [2] (upper half). Across the two child- hood samples, HI was a significant predictor of social impair- ment (relationships with peers and teachers) and more predic- tive of this domain than IA, whereas IA was a significant predictor of academic impairment and more predictive of this domain than HI. For classroom functioning, the pattern is mixed. In early childhood, HI is a stronger predictor of class- room functioning than IA, but in middle childhood, the pattern reverses. In the high school sample, IA was a significant and stronger predictor of all domains than HI.

Exploratory Analysis for Aim 1 Results of multivariate re- gression models investigating the unique relationship between hyperactivity and impulsivity and impairment (see lower half of Table [2] indicated that in the early childhood sample, hy- peractivity was a significant predictor of social impairment in (relationships with peers and teachers) and behavioral func- tioning, but impulsivity was not a significant predictor of im- pairment in any domains. In the middle childhood sample, the findings are mixed. In the high school sample, impulsivity was a significant predictor of impairment in relationships with peers and academic functioning. Hyperactivity was not a sig- nificant predictor of impairment in any domain.

**Aim 2**

Results of the stepwise regressions are presented in Tables [3]. Across the 12 models (three age groups by four IRS scores), only one symptom entered greater than 50 % of the models (7 of 12 models): Often interrupts or intrudes (significant for two domains in early childhood, three domains in middle childhood, and two domains in high school). Within any given domain of impairment, there were only two symptoms that en- tered the model for that domain for all three age groups (i.e., does not seem to listen predicting impairment in relationships with teacher, and avoids tasks that require sustained mental effort predicting academic impairment). Thus, other than these excep- tions, the combination of symptoms that is most predictive of impairment varies by age group and by domain of impairment.

To examine the negative beta under academic impairment for the high school sample, post hoc analyses were conducted. Results revealed that IA was functioning as a suppressor variable. At low levels of IA the correlations between HI and academic progress were negative and at high levels of IA the correlations between HI and academic progress were positive.

Just because a symptom failed to enter the final model does not mean it is unrelated to impairment, or would not be significant predictor if all symptoms were entered simultaneously. Rather the final models result in the best combination of symptoms to predict impairment at each age group. As such, we will discuss each domain separately and highlight patterns across domains of impairment and age groups.


**Discussion**

Our findings suggest that, in normative samples, the relation- ship between ADHD symptoms and impairment varies by age, domain of impairment, and symptom dimension. Replicating past research, our hypothesis for academic impair- ment was supported; IA is more associated with academic impairment than HI at all ages. Consistent with our hypothesis for social functioning, both with peers and teachers, HI is more associated than IA but only in early childhood. In ado- lescence, IA is significantly associated with social impair- ment. Lastly, for classroom functioning, the pattern is mixed across dimensions and ages with HI decreasing in association across the three age groups and IA increasing in association. Patterns also emerged in the relationship between individ- ual symptoms and impairment. Notably, HI symptoms entered the models more often for the early childhood sample than for the middle childhood and adolescent samples, wherein the majority of associated symptoms were from the IA dimension. Within the HI dimension, at the early childhood level, *on the go* had the strongest relationship with impairment across three out of the four domains. However, *on the go* was not included in the final models for the other two age groups. Within the HI dimension, at the middle childhood level *often leaves seat* had the strongest relationship with impairment in relationships with peers and teachers. In adolescence, within the HI domain, the impulsivity symptom *often interrupts or intrudes* had the strongest relationship with impairment across two domains (relationships with peers and classroom functioning). Within the IA dimension, at the early childhood level, *does not seem to listen* had the strongest relationship with impairment for three out of four domains. In the middle childhood sample there was variability in the IA symptoms that were the stron- gest predictors across domains. In adolescence, *does not fol- low through* has the strongest association across three domains of impairment. Although there are many factors that are pre- dictive of functioning in youth with ADHD, because DSM criteria re- quires symptom-related impairment, we discuss the relation- ship between symptoms and impairment as a function of symptom measurement (i.e., dimension scores or item scores),

age, and domain of impairment.

The Relationship Between ADHD Symptom Dimensions and Academic Impairment

The finding that was most consistent across all age groups is that IA is highly associated with academic impairment. This finding replicates previous research ;

Of note, it was observed that for the model in the high school sample predicting relationships with children the symptom talks excessively, and for the model predicting relationships with teachers the symptom fails to attend to details were significant, but not in the expected direction. Post hoc analyses revealed that in both instances the symptom forgetful in daily activities served as a suppressor variable. Specifically for both models, forgetful in daily activities was significantly correlated with the outcome variable at low levels but not high levels and strengthens the applicability of the finding, as limitations of previous research were addressed by using the same measures for all age groups, teacher report for high school students, and an impairment measure other than grades given that grades do not fully cap- ture interpersonal and academic behaviors included in models of academic functioning. This find- ing has two important implications. First, inattentive symp- tomatology may not be Bmore benign^ than hyperactive/impulsive symptomatology as once suggested. Indeed, given the replicated relationship and given the role that academic success has on future employ- ment and economic status, the presence of IA symptoms should become an important red flag for further assessment and the likely need for early and ongoing intervention. Second, results of a meta-analytic study indicate youth with impulsivity and hyperactivity are more often referred for treatment than youth exhibiting inattention, likely as a function of the disruption that they create in the classroom. Further this pattern may be more applicable to girls than boys, as there is evidence that girls are less likely to be referred for treatment of ADHD because they are more likely to present with inattentive symptoms than hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms. Because youth with attention difficulties may go unnoticed, unreferred, and untreated, brief screening measures that focus on IA symptoms may provide a systematic method for detect- ing and addressing this serious risk.

**The Relationship Between Individual Symptoms and Academic Impairment**

With regard to specific HI symptoms, in the early childhood sample, one HI symptom entered the model for academic impairment, but no HI symptoms entered the models for aca- demic impairment for the middle childhood or adolescent samples. Thus, the relationship between HI and academic progress appears be weaker for older students.

With regard to IA symptoms, avoids tasks requiring sustained mental effort was consistently included in the final models for impairment in academic progress across age groups. Thus, future research should examine the extent to which this symptom could serve as an efficient screening or gating question when assessing for academic impairment in youth. Additionally, difficulty orga- nizing was significantly predictive of academic impairment in both middle childhood and adolescence. This is consistent with the evidence that disorganization is a symptom that creates im- pairment in several childhood disorders and particularly so in ADHD. This finding suggests that it is im- portant to assess and treat organizational skills as early as third grade to prevent a trajectory of academic impairment. Students at both elementary and secondary levels who screen high on this symptom could be enrolled in a targeted support group or study hall in which they learn organizational skills in a systematic and structure way. This approach is consistent with a Life Course Model of treatment for children which pro- motes the use of interventions focused on competency develop- ment rather than accommodations that reduce expectations on the child. Given the emerging evidence for the effectiveness of organizational interventions with elementary school youth, such competency development may be maximized before children enter middle school.

**The Relationship Between ADHD Symptom Dimensions and Social Impairment**

HI was significantly associated with impairment in relationships with teachers and peers across early childhood and middle child- hood. This is consistent with early studies using teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms ()). However, the role of IA in social functioning appears to change with age, with IA being a significant predictor of social impairment for middle childhood and adolescent samples, but not for the early childhood sample. This is consistent with Tseng et al. study in which they found IA but not HI to be predictive of social impairment in a Chinese sample of fourth, fifth and sixth graders. In the ADHD literature the relationship between IA and social impairment in older youth has been hypothesized to occur due to youth with inattention problems having difficulty attending to positive behaviors of others and failing to understand cause and effect relationships in observed behavior. Other researchers have found a relationship between perfor- mance on auditory sustained attention tasks and emotion knowl- edge. Thus, it is possible that IA may be contributing to deficits in emotion knowledge, which in turn impacts social functioning. Together, these findings suggest that future research should examine the extent to which IA and HI symptoms, assessed in screening or diagnostic assessments, should be differentially considered, as evidence is amassing that each symptom dimension is associated with different types of impairment.

**The Relationship Between Individual Symptoms and Social Impairment**

The HI symptom, *often interrups and intrudes* , entered the final models for prediction of impairment across multiple age groups and domains of social impairment. This finding is consistent with previous research documenting the impact of negative behaviors on peer acceptance . Unfortunately, negative peer relations are highly resis- tant to change even when the child’s behavior has improved. Together these data suggest that teaching prosocial skills and the inhibition of intrusive verbal and phys- ical behaviors, while necessary, may be insufficient targets for interventions for social impairment. Indeed there is emerging evidence that modified interventions that target other social and cognitive processes and/or social contexts may be warranted. In addition, the IA symptom does not seem to listen entered the models for relationships with teachers for all age groups. Thus, for stu- dents who screen high on this symptom, further assessment of the student-teacher relationship and possible school-based strategies for preventing or reducing impairment in this do- main should be considered, as student-teacher relations are strongly predictive of subsequent academic outcomes.

Despite the broad trends across age, there were sev- eral symptoms significantly associated with impairment in social functioning (e.g., *on the go* for early childhood sample; *often leaves seat* for the middle childhood sam- ple; *forgetful in daily activities* for the adolescent sam- ple). These divergent findings across age groups under- score the possibility that the relationship between symp- toms and social impairment may change with age. Additionally, it is possible that high school teachers may have less insight into social relationships with peers because they typically only observe a given student for one period, which only represents a small portion of the peer contexts in which they function.

**Relationship Between Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Impairment in Adolescents**

Notably, there are numerous symptoms that were not entered in any of the final models for the prediction of impairment for adolescents. A majority of these symptoms fell in the HI do- main. This may be due to the fact that HI symptoms appear to diminish with age, but also may be attributable to a measure- ment issue. The current DSM HI symptoms may not fully capture manifestations of HI in adolescents and young adults (e.g., excessively laughing, inappropriate levels of excitement, acting immature without considering reactions, or unusually strong reactions to teasing or interactions with peers). Furthermore, results of the exploratory aim to examine the potential unique relationship between impulsivity and im- pairment within the adolescent sample indicated impulsivity was associated with impairment in peer relationships and ac- ademic functioning, but hyperactivity was not significantly associated with any domains of impairment for that age group. Given, the impulsivity factor is only comprised of three symp- toms, they may not capture the full range of impulsive behav- iors in adolescence. Further work is needed to understand how best to assess HI in adolescents.

**Clinical Implications**

Results of the current study indicate that the strength of the relationship between HI symptoms and impairment declines with age. On one hand, this finding is not surprising given that the DSM-IV field trials, which informed the current diagnostic criteria, had a sample that was skewed in age toward younger children. On the other hand, this declining relationship seems counterintuitive given that impulsive be- haviors related to substance use (, risky sexual behavior (), and dangerous driving ) increase with age. Indeed, our exploratory analyses revealed a stronger association between impulsivity and impairment than hyperactivity and impairment for adoles- cents. Although studies suggest that impulsivity is not a dis- tinct factor from hyperactivity , the current findings indicate the importance of impulsivity to impairment with adolescents and thus the importance of better capturing impulsivity via developmentally- appropriate symptoms descriptions. For example in adults makes decisions impulsively and acting before thinking differentiate individuals with and without ADHD , but these manifestations are not current- ly captured in the diagnostic criteria. It is possible that adjust- ments to the symptom descriptions in the current diagnostic criteria could result in better identification of adolescents most in need of intervention.

The results of this study also have other important implica- tions for school-based screening and assessment in the context of multi-tiered systems of support. With replication, feasible screening tools could be developed that only include those symptoms most related to impairment. Such a screening tool may help school professionals identify with early detection of the warning signs of future risk and provide the opportunity to take action (e.g., closer monitoring, conduct additional assess- ment, provide early intervention) prior to the development of significant impairment in child functioning (e.g., academic failure). Further, for elementary school-aged children, these screening tools could be compared to current procedures to determine if they enhance rates of true positive and reduce rates of false negatives with regard to those in need of further assessment or early intervention, or those who meet criteria for a diagnosis or special education services. A screening tool with the symptoms most associated with impairment may also help clinicians hone in on the best targets for intervention. Modified screening tools could also enhance efficiency in research studies if they were administered prior to a more lengthy diagnostic process, by decreasing the frequency with which youth without a disorder undergo an extensive assess- ment process. Additionally, the decision trees in existing structured interviews could be examined to determine whether the current gating questions are those that have stronger rela- tionships to impairment. Further research could explore whether having gating questions be those most linked to im- pairment enhances efficiency in the diagnostic and/or treat- ment planning processes. Such research could provide data to guide changes to the diagnostic criteria, such that symptoms could be weighted based on the strength of their relationship with impairment.

Although, further research is needed, the findings of this study also highlight some potential implications for early school-based intervention. First, it may be important to give greater consideration to the role of IA when developing aca- demic interventions. Specifically, does not seem to listen and difficulty organizing emerged as impairing aspects of IA. Teachers’ use of opportunities to respond (OTRs) is an effec- tive strategy for improving academic engagement and reduc- ing disruptive behavior in children receiving special education services  Future studies could examine the unique impact of OTRs on youth with clinically significant levels of inattention. Further, the finding that diffi- culty organizing is highly related to impairment across age underscores the importance of teaching children organization skills, particularly those at high risk for failure in this dimen- sion. Given the benefits of organizational skills for impaired youth at both elementary  and sec- ondary levels , future studies could examine the utility of integrating such training into schools during key transitions in the educational trajectory (e.g., when elementary students have more than one teacher; transition to middle school; transition to high school).

Lastly, the relationship between IA and social functioning observed in this study indicates that researchers should be cautious not to avoid considering the role of IA (e.g., missed nonverbal cues and reactions of others to their behavior, dif- ficulty determining cause and effect relationships) in the de- velopment of social functioning interventions. In one novel social functioning intervention, Interpersonal Skills Group , youth create social goals, and work to- ward them during social interactions. Then, youth rate their behavior in relationship to their goal and receive a rating from a staff member as well. This intervention focuses on increas- ing self-awareness and has shown some initial promising re- sults . It is possible that increased focus on the role of attention and social-cognitive processes could enhance social functioning for those impaired in this area.

**Limitations**

It is important to acknowledge several limitations when interpreting these results. First, because we only used teacher report it was not possible to determine which students met criteria for a clinical diagnosis of ADHD, thus we cannot confirm that all symptoms (e.g., of inattention) are associated with ADHD and not other disorders such as depression. In addition, the exclusive use of teacher ratings for the indepen- dent and dependent variables has the potential to create com- mon method bias and measurement error. In addition, we can- not know the extent to which rater bias is influencing our

results. Second, this study was conducted using a normative sample, thus we cannot be certain that the findings apply to a clinical sample. Third, due to power constraints we were not able to investigate whether the findings differed based on gen- der or other moderating variables. Fourth, although there is preliminary support for the use of the IRS with adolescents , it may not fully capture all domains of impairment in this age group, such as impairments associated with some risk-taking behaviors. Fifth, although stepwise re- gression was well suited to our research question, we ac- knowledge the procedure has limitations and in some situa- tions could lead to biased parameter estimates and that the chosen type of entry (forward) could affect the final model. Lastly, it is possible findings would differ if we used other universal measures of impairment such as grades, number of disciplinary referrals, or peer sociometric ratings.


**Conclusions**

This is the first study to examine the relationship between symptoms and impairment across several stages of childhood, using a single measure of impairment, assessing multiple do- mains of impairment separately, and examining the symptom- impairment relationship using both symptom dimension and individual symptoms. Our results replicate previous findings and extend our understanding of the relationship between symptoms and impairment across development. The findings highlight several important avenues for future research with regard to the development of new screening instruments, cre- ation of developmentally-appropriate symptom descriptions, and possible differential weighting of symptoms to enhance diagnostic efficiency.
