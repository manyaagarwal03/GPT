The diagnosis of ADHD requires the presence for at least six months of six of nine possible symptoms of inattention-disorganization and/or six of nine symptoms of hyper- activity-impulsivity, and an onset before the age of 12. Diagnosis also requires the cross- situational display of symptoms (i.e. at home, at school), and functional impairment.

ADHD has been associated with a wide variety of adverse educational, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes (Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72)). There is a solid body of research supporting the presence of impairments in a multiplicity of domains of cognitive functioning in children and adolescents with ADHD compared to their typically developing peers (Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72); Hale et al., [2012](#_bookmark21); Krieger & Amador-Campos, [2018](#_bookmark14); Toplak et al., [2009](#_bookmark22)). These deficits included poor performance on measures of intellectual <a name="_bookmark47"></a>functioning, attentional control, performance-based measures of executive functions (EF), and rating scales of EF (Berger & Cassuto, [2014](#_bookmark71); Krieger & Amador-Campos, [2018](#_bookmark14); Pievsky & McGrath, [2018](#_bookmark1); Thaler et al., [2012](#_bookmark17); Toplak et al., [2009](#_bookmark22)). In particular, <a name="_bookmark46"></a>the results of several studies have shown a core of deficits in working memory, processing speed and selective and sustained attention in ADHD groups (Areces et al., [2018](#_bookmark67); Luo et al., [2019](#_bookmark23); Thaler et al., [2012](#_bookmark17); Wassenberg et al., [2008](#_bookmark2)). These cognitive performance <a name="_bookmark48"></a>impairments display significant and well-documented heterogeneity and stability through the developmental course in individuals with ADHD (e.g. Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72); Luo et al., [2019](#_bookmark23); Pievsky & McGrath, [2018](#_bookmark1)).

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, APA, [2013](#_bookmark64)) distinguish three subcategories or presentations of ADHD: the predominantly inattentive presentation (ADHD-I), the predominantly impulsive/hyperactive presentation (ADHD-HI) and the combined presentation (ADHD-C. A number of cognitive deficits have been identified in ADHD clinical presentations in childhood and adolescence (Barnett et al., [2005](#_bookmark69); Mayes et al., [2009](#_bookmark24); Nikolas & Nigg, [2013](#_bookmark3)). ADHD-I is associated with poorer performance on tests of processing speed, sustained attention (e.g. omission errors) and verbal/visuospatial working memory (e.g. Adams et al., [2008](#_bookmark65); Mayes et al., [2009](#_bookmark24); Yang et al., [2013](#_bookmark25)). ADHD-C is associated with deficits on measures of visuospatial <a name="_bookmark49"></a>working memory, processing speed, sustained attention and vigilance (e.g. commission errors and distractibility) and inhibitory control (e.g. Adams et al., [2008](#_bookmark65); Barnett et al., [2005](#_bookmark69); Nikolas & Nigg, [2013](#_bookmark3); Walg et al., [2017](#_bookmark26)). It should be noted that some studies comparing cognitive impairments between ADHD presentations have shown mixed results. For instance, Krieger and Amador-Campos ([2018](#_bookmark14)) found no differences between ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups of adolescents on cognitive measures of visual working memory and inhibition using the spatial span of the Wechsler Nonverbal scale of ability (WNV; Wechsler & Naglieri, [2011](#_bookmark1)) and commission errors and total test effectiveness on the d2 Test of Attention. By contrast, Nikolas and Nigg ([2013](#_bookmark3)) in a sample of youth (aged 6–17 years) found consistent evidence that ADHD-C group performed worse than ADHD-I group in all neuropsychological domains (e.g. cognitive control, inhibition, working memory or memory span) except in measures of processing speed where the ADHD-I group had more difficulties than their ADHD-C peers. Also, Mayes et al. ([2009](#_bookmark24)) reported lower scores for children with ADHD-I and ADHD-C than for controls on the Working Memory (WM) Index of WISC-IV (Wechsler, [2005](#_bookmark4)) and on the vigilance and distractibility index of the Gordon Diagnostic System (GDS; Gordon & Mettelman, [1987](#_bookmark27)). In the same study, the ADHD-I group performed worse on the Processing Speed Index (PRS) of WISC-IV while ADHD-C group had higher scores on the delay


task score of the GDS. On the other hand, several studies suggest that once the symptoms of inattention are controlled, the association between certain cognitive deficits and the symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity is no longer significant (e.g. Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20)). Overall, the research evidence suggests that ADHD-I and ADHD-C presentations share more similarities than differences in neuropsychological weaknesses (Walg et al., [2017](#_bookmark26); Willcutt et al., [2005](#_bookmark18), [2012](#_bookmark20)).

Some authors point out that it is difficult to distinguish between different ADHD presentations in terms of neuropsychological functioning, probably due to the high overlap that exists between the two ADHD symptom domains (Nigg, [2016](#_bookmark44); Wählstedt et al., [2009](#_bookmark28)). Furthermore, as suggested by Nikolas and Nigg ([2013](#_bookmark3)), and Nigg ([2016](#_bookmark44)) ADHD presentations may reflect differences in the severity of neurocognitive impairments rather than categorically distinct conditions. This is complicated even further by the fact that the heterogeneity of neurocognitive profiles observed in ADHD presentations may be due to the cognitive domain evaluated (Nigg et al., [2002](#_bookmark0)), may be present in typically developing children (Fair et al., [2012](#_bookmark26)), and may be related to the long wave of temporal instability of the symptoms of ADHD (Fair et al., [2012](#_bookmark26)). In this regard, in a sample of 498 partici- pants (213 with TD and 285 with ADHD) aged 6–17, Fair et al. ([2012](#_bookmark26)) found four different neuropsychological profiles established from 20 different neuropsychologi- cal measures. These profiles appeared both in TD participants and in those with ADHD, and allowed a relatively accurate classification of the groups. As the authors state, “some of the heterogeneity within ADHD appears to be nested within the variation found in typically developing populations” (p. 6773). In addition, Nigg et al. ([2005](#_bookmark5)) found a substantial overlap in the distribution of ADHD and control in performances on measures of neuropsychological functioning.

Evidence from developmental studies has shown that ADHD-associated neurocog-

nitive deficits (e.g. lower IQ scores and poor performance on measures of inhibition, working memory and sustained attention) tend to persist over time, even regardless of the course of the disorder (Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72); Halperin et al., [2008](#_bookmark29); McAuley et al., [2014](#_bookmark30)). Also, the continuity of ADHD core symptoms may be associated with the persistence of cognitive deficits, as observed in some studies with both ADHD persis- ters and remitters (Franke et al., [2018](#_bookmark10); Halperin et al., [2008](#_bookmark29)). Coghill et al. ([2014](#_bookmark23)) tested whether improvements in executive functioning are associated with clinical improve- ment in a sample of 17 boys with ADHD and 17 TD assessed on two occasions (at 10 years, time 1, and 14 years, time 2). They found that all participants presented improved neuropsychological and clinical functioning over time, but they did not report an association between changes in both executive functions and symptom severity.

These complex relationships between ADHD presentations and cognitive func- <a name="_bookmark50"></a>tioning may be related to alterations in the maturational trajectory of some brain regions during childhood and adolescence (e.g. Bjorklund & Causey, [2018](#_bookmark73); Shaw et al., [2008](#_bookmark31), [2014](#_bookmark45)). In effect, although human cortical development is heterogeneous across regions and there is no clear consensus on general cortical thickness devel- opmental trends (Walhovd et al., [2017](#_bookmark0)), there is evidence that during adolescence, cortical thickness shows differential patterns of maturation in regions linked to cognition and behavioral regulation development (Vijayakumar et al., [2016](#_bookmark32), [2018](#_bookmark24)).


In this regard, prior research on ADHD has revealed relationships between devel- opmental delays of cortical thinning in prefrontal regions (e.g. frontoparietal, ventral and dorsal networks) and deficits in cognitive functions such as executive atten- tional control, sustained attention, processing speed, working memory and inhibi- tion (Castellanos & Aoki, [2016](#_bookmark33); Franke et al., [2018](#_bookmark10); Shaw et al., [2013](#_bookmark28)). In effect, <a name="_bookmark51"></a>these cognitive functions present major increases in development during late child- hood and adolescence (Anderson & Spencer-Smith, [2013](#_bookmark66); Brocki & Bohlin, [2004](#_bookmark12); Brocki et al., [2008](#_bookmark11)). This point is relevant, since some studies have reported that the processing speed, working memory and attentional resources are related to each other and that they have a differential impact on certain deficits present in groups with ADHD: for example, difficulties in academic achievement and reading fluency (e.g. Jacobson et al., [2011](#_bookmark5); Weigard & Huang-Pollock, [2017](#_bookmark7)).

On the other hand, core symptoms of both ADHD presentations (i.e. inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity) are related to aberrant connectivity within the cingulo– frontoparietal (CFP) attention/visual networks for ADHD-I and within the default mode (DMN; e.g. medial prefrontal cortex), cerebellum and motor networks for ADHD-C (Saad et al., [2020](#_bookmark17)). Numerous studies have shown nuanced developmental changes in the trajectory of symptoms for each subtype of ADHD (for a review, see Greven et al., [2011](#_bookmark23); Sasser et al., [2016](#_bookmark22)). Hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms tend to decline with age, although they do not normalize, while inattentive symptoms remain- ing relatively constant over time from middle childhood until adulthood. Additionally, the symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity during middle childhood contribute to the presence of symptoms of inattention during early adolescence (Greven et al., [2011](#_bookmark23)); this appears to be reflected in the shift from ADHD-C to ADHD-I, across the develop- mental course from childhood to adolescence (Saad et al., [2020](#_bookmark17); Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20)). Finally, some studies suggest that in the ADHD-I presentation the onset of deficits in attentional processes develops later than in the ADHD-C presentation (Saad et al., [2020](#_bookmark17)). Thus, as suggested by Halperin and Schulz ([2006](#_bookmark32)), the prefrontal cortex and its functional measures are closely related to the course and severity of ADHD symptoms, especially in adolescence and adulthood.

In all, neuroanatomical developmental differences during late childhood and ado-

lescence in task-specific brain networks (e.g. sustained attention, processing efficiency and working memory), which are intimately linked to both cognitive performance and clinical course of ADHD symptoms, may represent a framework for explaining the neurocognitive characterization of ADHD presentations. Therefore, the current study sought to examine the relationships between neuropsychological performance and the two most common ADHD presentations (ADHD-I and ADHD-C) across two different age cohorts (children aged 8 to 12 and adolescents aged 13 to 16 years old). We hypothesized that: 1) Children and adolescents in the TD group would score higher than those in the ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups on the WISC-IV general ability index (GAI); 2) ADHD groups would perform worse than TD on all neuropsychological measures and that differences in performance (i.e. WM, PRS and attention) would be found between children and adolescents with ADHD-I and ADHD-C; and 3) Neuropsychological measures of WM, PRS and attention domains would accurately predict group membership (ADHD presentations vs TD) in all age ranges.

## <a name="participants"></a>***Participants***
The sample included 260 children and adolescents aged between 8 and 16 years. The ADHD group comprised 138 participants (70 ADHD-I, age: *M* = 11.26, *SD* = 2.34, 72.9% males and 68 ADHD-C, age: *M* = 12.91, *SD* = 12.04, 75% males), while the TD group consisted of 122 participants (age: *M* = 11.70, *SD* = 2.35, 42.6% males) See [Figure 1](#_bookmark53) for more details on the sample composition.

This study is part of a project that evaluates the relationship between ADHD symp- toms, executive functions, temperament, and personality characteristics in children and adolescents with ADHD and controls. One hundred and eighteen participants came from Krieger and Amador-Campos ([2018](#_bookmark14)), and 142 participants were recruited for the present study. Participants with ADHD were recruited through three regional Child and Adolescent Mental Health Centers and a University Psychological Service. The control group was recruited from a regional primary and secondary school. Almost all children and adolescents (90%) lived in two-parent families. Participants in the ADHD group were required to meet DSM–5 (APA, [2013](#_bookmark64)) cutoff criteria for core symptoms of ADHD, age of onset, chronicity, impairment, and cross-situational manifestations. Diagnostic <a name="_bookmark52"></a>assignment to ADHD-I and ADHD-C was determined using data from the Clinical Interview–Parent Report Form (Barkley & Murphy, [2006](#_bookmark68)) and the Conners-3 parent and teacher rating scales (Conners, [2008](#_bookmark32)). ADHD-I participants met all the criteria for inattention but not those for hyperactivity–impulsivity in the Clinical Interview; they had a T score ≥ 65 on both the DSM inattentive scale and the ADHD Index, and a T score

< 65 on the DSM hyperactive–impulsive scale of the Conners 3, as assessed by parents

and teachers. ADHD-C participants met the criteria for inattention and hyperactivity– impulsivity in the Clinical Interview and had T scores ≥ 65 on both the DSM Inattentive and Hyperactive – Impulsive scales and the ADHD Index of the Conners-3, as reported by parents and teachers. Participants in the TD group had fewer than six symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity–impulsivity on the Clinical Interview and T scores ≤ 60 on both the DSM Inattentive and Hyperactive–Impulsive scales and the ADHD Index of the Conners 3, as rated by parents and teachers.

In order to improve diagnostic reliability, all cases (*N* = 260) were selected following the unanimous agreement of a panel of experts (two psychologists and a psychiatrist certified in clinical child and adolescent psychology). Exclusion criteria were: history of tics; neurological disorders, or sensory impairments (seizures or brain injury); mental health conditions including autism spectrum disorder, motor or communication dis- orders and Tourette’s syndrome, and a General Ability Index (GAI) < 85 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Fourth Edition (Wechsler, [2005](#_bookmark4)).

This study was approved by the Mental Health Services Research Ethics Committee of the child and adolescent care centers (CSMC/2014-2018), the univer- sity psychology service ethics committee, and the management board of the schools. Participation was voluntary in all cases, no financial compensation was offered, and all parents or legal guardians provided written informed consent. All children and adolescents selected to participate in this study also provided verbal assent. The study complied with the principles of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki (revised in Tokyo in 2014). Participants taking psychostimulant medication (10 ADHD participants, 7.2%) were asked to withhold medication for 24 hours prior to each testing session, under the supervision of both primary care physicians and their parents/careers or legal guardians.

## <a name="procedure"></a>***Procedure***
The recruitment of the participants was as follows. For the TD group, parents and teachers were informed of the aims and procedures of the study in meetings held at the schools; for the ADHD group, parents or legal guardians were informed about the study and invited to attend an information session held at the mental health centers or the university psychological service. Eligible children with ADHD were initially identified and recruited through referring practitioners (i.e. child psychiatrists, physicians or psychologists) at these services. The instruments were administered in four assessment sessions. In session 1, a clinical interview with parents and caregivers covered the developmental and medical information about the children, chronicity and pervasiveness of ADHD symptoms, and associated functional impairment; in sessions 2 to 4, different tests of intelligence, cognitive and behavioral executive functions, temperament and personality (reported in Krieger & Amador-Campos, [2018](#_bookmark14); Krieger et al., [2019](#_bookmark19) and Krieger et al., [2020](#_bookmark27)) were administered. Once the evaluation process was completed, all participants received a written report with the results of the assessment. Participants in the ADHD group also attended a feedback session in the presence of their parents and the reference health professional. A trained master’s level clinical psychologist collected all the data under the supervision of a doctoral level clinical psychologist.


## <a name="instruments"></a>***Instruments***
Detailed descriptions of the tests administered have been published in previous reports (Krieger & Amador-Campos, [2018](#_bookmark14); Krieger et al., [2019](#_bookmark19), and Krieger et al., [2020](#_bookmark27)). [Table 1](#_bookmark54) contains a brief description of the measures of ADHD symptoms, intelligence and attention tests used in this paper.

## <a name="data analysis plan"></a>***Data analysis plan***
To analyze groups differences regarding gender, Chi-squared were used. ANOVAs were used to examine differences between groups in age, clinical symptoms and WISC-IV GAI. Since the tasks used to measure working memory [WM: Digit Span (DS) and Letter- Number sequencing, (LN)], processing speed [PRS: Coding (C) and Symbols Search (SS)] and attention (d2 task parameters: PS, PSc, INa, IMp, CP and E%) grouped different types of scores (i.e. scaled scores, raw scores or percentile), they were transformed into Z-scores. To assess kurtosis and skewness coefficients of the data obtained from working memory, processing speed and attention tasks, Kline’s guidelines were taken into account: Acceptable values of kurtosis and skewness fall between < 3.0 and < 10.0 respectively (Kline, [2020](#_bookmark10)). Two separate MANOVAs and MANCOVAs were performed to test whether significant differences existed between children with ADHD-I, ADHD-C and TD by age group in performance on the WM, PRS indexes and d2 task parameters, and whether these differences remained significant after controlling for gender. Bonferroni or Games-Howell corrections for multiple testing were used to control type I error rates. To calculate the standardized mean differences between groups on the tests of WM, PRS, and d2 task parameters, Cohen’s *d* index of effect size was used. Cohen’s effect size guidelines were: 0.20, small; 0.50, medium, 0.80, large (Cohen, [1992](#_bookmark34)) and values of 1.30 were considered very large (Sullivan & Feinn, [2012](#_bookmark19)). Finally, a discriminant analysis was conducted to examine the degree to which WM, PRS, and attention measures predict group membership of ADHD and TD groups. All WM (i.e. D and LN), PRS (i.e. C and SS) and d2 task parameters (i.e. PS, PSc, INa, IMp, CP and E%) were analyzed together, using a stepwise selection procedure with the criterion of F-value (F-to-enter: > 3.84 and F-to-remove: < 2.71) and the Wilks’ lambda method.

In this study, the GAI based on verbal comprehension (VC) and perceptual reasoning (PR) composite scores was taken into account because the estimation of this index in comparison to the Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) excludes the contribution of the WM or PRS subtests, both taken as independent variables in the current study. The evidence suggests that the GAI index represents an alternative way to assess overall ability (Saklofske et al., [2005](#_bookmark20); Weiss et al., [2016](#_bookmark12)) since VC and PR indexes can account for most of the FSIQ variance in ADHD groups (Fiorello et al., [2002](#_bookmark1)).

# <a name="results"></a>**Results**
The groups did not show differences in age [*F*(2, 257) = 2.67, *p* = .07]. Statistically significant differences between groups were found for gender, χ<sup>2</sup> (1, N = 260) = 26.25, *p* < .001. Consequently, gender was taken into account for further analysis. As can be seen in [Table 2](#_bookmark56), there were significant differences between ADHD-I, ADHD-C and TD groups

Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV)

Records information from parents of children and adolescents. Covers seven areas: parental concerns and reasons for the assessment; information on the family environment; health and temperament during the

first year; school and social history; assessment history and previous treatments; review of DSM disorders (ADHD, defiant oppositional/negative, dissocial, bipolar, anxiety and mood); and family history (psychopathological background of parents and siblings)

Evaluates inattention, and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and related problems in executive functioning, learning problems, defiance-aggression, and peer and family relationships. Also evaluates symptoms related to the DSM-IV-TR (2000) criteria for conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and some internalization symptoms (anxiety and depression). The Conners-3 scales include forms for parents (Conners 3-P: 6–18 years), teachers (Conners 3-T; 6–18 years) and youth (Conners 3-SR:

8–18 years), and also proposes three options: full-length, short, and index forms. Here the long forms for both parent and teacher versions were used.

Records information (i.e. three items) on the level of impairment caused by ADHD symptoms in social, family and academic settings. Parents rated the impairment on a scale from zero to three (0 = No impairment;

3 = Severe impairment). The raw scores for ADHD symptoms impairments were used

Individually administered scale of intelligence for children aged 6–16 years. The composite scores of verbal comprehension (VC), perceptual reasoning (PR), Working memory (WM), and Processing speed (PRS) and General Ability Index (GAI), based on VC and PR subtests were recorded.

![ref5]d2 Test of Attention  A paper-and-pencil cancellation task

that evaluates selective and sustained attention, and processing speed. This test consists of a set of 47 letters “p” and “d” randomly presented in 14 lines which have some small dashes arranged individually or in pairs for each letter. The participant must scan each line to identify and cross out only the target symbol d with two dashes, regardless of whether the dashes appear above, below, or one dash above and one dash below the letter, within a specified time limit of 4 minutes and 40 seconds, without pauses allowed between trials. This task yields performance indexes of: Processing Speed (PS; total number of processed items); errors of omission (O; total number of relevant items not canceled); errors of commission (C; total of non-relevant items canceled); Processing Speed corrected (PSc; processing speed minus number of O and C errors); Concentration Performance (CP; total number of crossed-out target items minus the number of C errors); and Accuracy [E%; total number of errors (C + O) divided by processing speed]. In this study, the PS, PSc, CP and E% indices were used. Additionally, two supplementary performance indexes were estimated: Inattention (INa; O errors divided by processing speed) and Impulsivity (IMp; C errors divided by processing speed). Both these measures were used in this study, since previous studies (Wassenberg et al., [2008](#_bookmark2)) in samples of schoolchildren (i.e. grades 2 to 6) have reported that the impulsivity and inattention indexes provided by the d2 test are sensitive to differential trajectories of age-related changes in several aspects of selective attention skills.

In this sample the reliability (Cronbach’s α) ranged between .74

(concentration) and .90 (errors of omission).

significant. Notably, the ADHD-C group showed higher scores than ADHD-I in all inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive scales and the ADHD index according to both parents and teachers, except in the inattentive scale of the teachers’ report in which the ADHD-I group scored higher than the ADHD-C group. The ADHD-C group also showed higher scores in the three functional impairment indexes rated by parents.

Univariate analysis revealed significant differences between TD and ADHD groups on the WISC-IV GAI scores in children of 8 to 12 years old, but not in teens aged 13 to 16. There were no significant differences between ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups in the GAI scores ([Table 3](#_bookmark57)).

The kurtosis and skewness coefficients of WM and PRS indexes and d2 task para- meters met Kline’s criterion, which thus allowed the performance of parametric test procedures ([Table 4](#_bookmark58)).

[Tables 5](#_bookmark59) and [Tables 6](#_bookmark60) summarizes the descriptive data and the results of MANOVAs, Cohen’s d effect size and MANCOVAs for WM and PRS indexes and d2 task parameters across the ADHD and TD groups for both age ranges.

## ***Age range 1 (G1, 8 to 12 years old)***
There was a statistically significant group effect in WM and PRS indexes: Wilks’ Λ = 0.59, *F* (8, 280) = 10.58, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .23. Univariate analysis ([Table 5](#_bookmark59)) showed significant main differences between both ADHD groups and TD on measures of WM [DS: *F*(2, 143) = 17.34, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .20; and LN: *F*(2, 143) = 16.44, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .19]

partial η<sup>2</sup> = .22]. The post hoc analysis showed that WM and PRS subtest scores were higher for TD than for ADHD groups, except in DS, in which the ADHD-I and TD groups scored significantly higher than the ADHD-C group. In LN, C and SS there were no significant

differences between the ADHD groups. Statistically significantly differences were found between ADHD-I and TD groups on subtests of WM and PRS, with a large effect size for SS (*d* = – 1.08), medium for C (*d* = – 0.71) and LN (*d* = – 0.68), and small for DS (*d* = – 0.12). Compared to TD, children with ADHD-C presented a significant larger effect size on all subtests of WM and PRS [DS (*d* = – 1.10), SS (*d* = – 1.10), LN (*d* = – 1.06) and C (*d* = – 0.87)].

Regarding d2 task parameters, there was a statistically significant main effect for group: Wilks’ Λ = 0.51, *F*(12, 276) = 9,08, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .28. Univariate analysis ([Table 6](#_bookmark60)) revealed significant differences between ADHD-I, ADHD-C and TD groups for PS [*F*(2, 143) = 25.80, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .27] and CP [*F*(2, 143) = 33.45, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .32]. After

Bonferroni post hoc adjustment, significant differences were found between the three groups in PS and CP parameters, with highest scores for TD, followed by ADHD-I and ADHD-C. For PSc, INa, IMp and E% parameters the equal variance assumption was violated; therefore, the Brown-Forsythe F-ratio is reported, and revealed a significant group difference for PSc [*F*(2, 126.25) = 41.83, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .34], INa [*F*(2, 74.97) = 19.33, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .26], IMp [*F*(2, 85.48) = 28.42, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .30] and E%

[*F*(2, 84) = 32.26, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .35]. A post hoc comparison using the Games-Howell test indicated that ADHD-C group scored higher than ADHD-I and TD groups in E%. For PSc, the TD group scored higher than ADHD-I and ADHD-C, and there were significant differences between ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups. For INa, ADHD groups scored significantly higher than TD but there were no significant differences between ADHD-I and ADHD-C. In IMp, ADHD-C scored higher than ADHD-I and TD groups, although there were no significant differences between ADHD-I and TD. In addition, significant group differences between ADHD-I and TD with a large effect size were identified for E% (*d* = 1.06), INa (*d* = 1.02) and PSc (*d* = – 0.84); and a medium effect size for CP (*d* = – 0.73), PS (*d* = – 0.68) and IMp (*d* = 0.65). For children with ADHD-C, compared with TD, a significant group difference with a large to very large effect size was found for d2 parameters [E% (*d* = 1.70), PSc (*d* = –1.55), IMp (*d* = 1.54), INa (*d* = 1.40) and CP (*d* = –1.17)], except for PS, which as medium (*d* = –0.67)].

MANCOVAs were performed to compare ADHD and TD groups on WM and PRS subtests and d2 task parameters with gender included as covariate. MANCOVA results revealed that after controlling for gender, the group effects remained significant for WM and PRS subtests, Pillai’s trace = .42, *F*(8, 280) = 9.02, *p* = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .21; and d2 task parameters, Pillai’s trace = .51, *F*(12, 276) = 7.84, *p* = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .25.

## ***Age range 2 (G2, 13 to 16 years old)***
There was a statistically significant main group effect only in PRS measures: Wilks’ Λ = 0.73, *F*(8, 216) = 4,56, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .14. Univariate analysis ([Table 5](#_bookmark59)) showed significant main differences between both ADHD groups and TD on subtests of PRS [C: F (2, 111) = 16.77, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .23; and SS: *F*(2, 111) = 7.02, *p* = .001, partial

η<sup>2</sup> = .11]; but not in those of WM [DS: *F*(2, 111) = 1.57, *p* = .21, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .03; and LN: *F* (2, 111) = 2.50, *p* = .08, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .04]. The post hoc analysis showed that PRS subtest scores were higher in TD than ADHD groups; and scores of C and SS were not significantly different between the two ADHD groups. In particular, significant group differences between ADHD-I and TD groups with a large effect size were identified for C (*d* = – 1.13) and a medium effect size for SS (*d* = – 0.76). A group difference between adolescents with ADHD-C and TD with a large effect size were found for C (*d* = – 0.86) and a small effect size for SS (*d* = – 0.43).

Regarding d2 task parameters ([Table 6](#_bookmark60)), the groups presented statistically significant differences: Wilks’ Λ = 0.74, *F*(12, 212) = 2.81, *p* = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .14. Univariate analysis revealed significant differences between ADHD and TD groups for PS [*F*(2, 111) = 12.47, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .18] and CP [*F*(2, 111) = 5.96, *p* = .003; η<sup>2</sup> = .10]. After

Bonferroni post hoc adjustment, significant differences were found between the three groups in PS and CP parameters, with higher scores for TD than for ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups; there were no significant differences between ADHD groups. For PSc, INa, IMp and E% parameters the equal variance assumption was violated; therefore, the Brown-Forsythe F-ratio is reported, and revealed a significant group differences for PSc [*F*(2, 108.32) = 11.31, *p* = .001; η<sup>2</sup> = .15], INa [*F*(2, 71.04) = 4.75, *p* = .01; η<sup>2</sup> = .08], IMp [*F*

(2, 63.64) = 5.04, *p* = .009; η<sup>2</sup> = .10] and E% [*F*(2, 59.39) = 6.78, *p* = .002; η<sup>2</sup> = .13]. A post

hoc comparison using the Games-Howell test indicated that ADHD-C and ADHD-I scored higher than TD in INa, IMp, and E%, while for PSc, both ADHD groups had lower scores than TD. The scores for the four d2 parameters did not differ across the ADHD groups.

There were significant group differences between ADHD-I and TD groups with a large effect size for PSc (*d* = – 0.88), and with a medium effect size for E% (*d* = 0.78), PS (*d* = – 0.75), IMp (*d* = 0.77), INa (*d* = 0.61) and CP (*d* = – 0.60). There were also significant group differences among adolescents with ADHD-C and TD, with large effect sizes for PSc (*d* = – 1.10), E% (*d* = 0.97), IMp (*d* = 0.94) and PS (*d* = – 0.91), and medium effect sizes for INa (*d* = 0.77) and CP (*d* = – 0.65).

MANCOVAs were performed to compare ADHD and TD groups in PRS subtests and d2 task parameters, with gender included as covariate. MANCOVAs results revealed that after controlling for gender, the group effects remained significant for PRS tests, Pillai’s trace = .22, *F*(4, 220) = 6.88, *p* = .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .11; and d2 task parameters, Pillai’s trace = .27, *F*(12, 212) = 2.73, *p* = .002, η<sup>2</sup> = .13.

Finally, in adolescents with ADHD-I, a large effect size was found for differences between G1 and G2 age ranges in PS (*d* = – 1.29), PSc (*d* = – 1.23), CP (*d* = – 1.00) and C (*d* = – 0.81); medium size for DS (*d* = 0.74) and small effect sizes for all other subtests of PRS and WM and d2 task parameters [INa (*d* = – 0.40), E% (*d* = – 0.38), SS (*d* = 0.17), IMp (*d* = – 0.10) and LN (*d* = – 0.03)]. For adolescents with ADHD-C, there were significant group differences with a very large effect size between G1 and G2 age

ranges in PS (*d* = – 2.30), PSc (*d* = – 2.08) and CP (*d* = – 1.60); medium size for IMp (*d* = 0.76), E% (*d* = 0.74), INa (*d* = 0.61), DS (*d* = − 0.56) and C (*d* = 0.55); and small

size for LN (*d* = – 0.34) and SS (*d* = – 0.13). Lastly, in the TD group, a very large effect size was found for differences across age ranges G1 and G2 in PS (*d* = – 1.34), large effect size for PSc (*d* = – 1.28); medium size for CP (*d* = – 0.72); and small effect for DS (*d* = 0.42), C (*d* = 0.41), SS (*d* = 0.39), LN (*d* = 0.34), Imp (*d* = 0.28), E% (*d* = 0.08) and

INa (*d* = – 0.08). As observed in [Figures 2](#_bookmark61) and [3](#_bookmark63), both ADHD presentations in the 8–12 years and 13–16 years age ranges performed worse on the WM and PRS subtests and d2 task parameters than TD Also, the pattern of d2 task performance on ADHD-I and ADHD-C presentations differed more in the G1 age range than in the G2 age range.

# <a name="discussion"></a>**Discussion**
This study examined the neuropsychological performance of ADHD and TD children and adolescents in two different age ranges: late childhood (8 to 12 years old) and adolescence (13 to 16 years old). We hypothesized that cognitive and attention measures could reliably differentiate clinical ADHD presentations and TD. The findings partially supported our first hypothesis, since there were statistically significant differences between ADHD and TD groups in the WISC-IV GAI scores in the G1 age range. In line with previous studies in samples of children and adolescents, the TD group had a higher mean score than the ADHD groups (e.g. Devena & Watkins, [2012](#_bookmark29); Jacobson et al., [2011](#_bookmark5)). In the G2, there were no significant differences between the ADHD and TD groups in the GAI scores. This finding is interesting in the light of previous literature reporting similar results, with ADHD adolescents showing GAI scores within an average range but lower than in the control group (Jacobson et al., [2011](#_bookmark5)). These results may be associated with both the developmental reorganization during puberty of the crystallized and fluid abilities (e.g. Simpson-Kent et al., [2020](#_bookmark2)) related to the VC and PR subtests from which the GAI is derived, and also with the fact that the GAI does not include WM and PRS subtests, on which many adolescents with ADHD perform worse (Krieger & Amador-Campos, [2018](#_bookmark14); Mayes & Calhoun, [2006](#_bookmark35)). Thus, in a sample of ADHD children with a mean age of 11.5 years, Fiorello et al. ([2002](#_bookmark1)) found that VC and PR scores accounted for most of the variance in Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ). These findings provide supplementary evidence that the GAI index may represent an alter- native way to summarize cognitive ability in clinical groups with high variability in cognitive profiles, as seen in the ADHD groups.

Our second hypothesis was only partially confirmed: children with ADHD presenta- tions had poorer performances than TD on all neuropsychological measures, while in adolescents there were significant differences only on PRS and attention measures. Significant differences in neuropsychological performance were also found between children and adolescents with ADHD-I and ADHD-C presentations.


## <a name="children (g1, 8 to 12€years old)"></a>***Children (G1, 8 to 12 years old)***
Children with ADHD performed worse than TD in WM, PRS and attention. In parti- cular, ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups scored lower on WM (i.e. LN) and PRS (i.e. C and SS) subtests with respect to TD group. Similarly, Mayes and Calhoun ([2006](#_bookmark35)) found that scores on LN, C and SS subtests were significantly lower than other subtests of WISC-IV in ADHD children. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that there were no differences between the ADHD-I and TD group in performance on the DS subtest. In agreement with these findings, Rosenthal et al. ([2006](#_bookmark13)) found no group differences between ADHD-I, and control groups in performance on DS or digits forward in a sample of 90 children and adolescents, but the ADHD-I group was able to recall more digits backward than the ADHD-C group. The results of our study agree with those of Rosenthal et al. ([2006](#_bookmark13)) in terms of the similarity of the performance of ADHD-I and controls in DS. It is possible that our results are influenced by the unequal sample sizes, which may have limited the statistical power to detect significant differences between groups. The effect sizes, from

medium to large, obtained for almost WM and PRS subtests suggest that these measures can be useful for distinguishing ADHD and TD groups.

Regarding attention, children in the TD group performed better on d2 task parameters than ADHD groups. This finding agrees with two previous studies (González-Castro et al., [2015](#_bookmark15); Yato et al., [2019](#_bookmark34)) who reported the presence of deficits in performance on the d2 attention test in children with ADHD. Concerning differences between the three groups, the ADHD-C group had more difficulties in processing speed (PS and PSc), concentration (CP) and accuracy (E%) than ADHD-I and TD, and ADHD-I had more difficulties than TD. In addition, ADHD-C showed more impulsivity (IMp) than ADHD-I and TD, and both presentations of ADHD had more inattention (INa) than TD. These results are at odds with those reported by González-Castro et al. ([2015](#_bookmark15)), in which the ADHD-I group scored lowest on the d2 test (i.e. Concentration and Total effectiveness), followed by the ADHD-C and control groups. To some extent, this may be explained by the parameters we used to assess performance on d2 and by the unequal sample sizes among the three groups in our sample, which may have increased the susceptibility to unequal variances. Further, the two ADHD groups appeared to show similar results, with higher scores in the inattention parameter (INa) relative to their TD peers. This finding is particularly significant, given that some studies (e.g. Chhabildas et al., [2001](#_bookmark36); Huang-Pollock et al., [2006](#_bookmark0); Kuntsi et al., [2014](#_bookmark33)) have suggested that inattentive domain and vigilance deficits can be important hallmarks of both ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups, which are associated with outcomes in neuropsycho- logical tests. The effect sizes, from medium to large in the ADHD-I group, and from medium to very large in the ADHD-C group, suggest that d2 task parameters distinguish the ADHD-C subtype slightly better than the ADHD-I subtype relative to TD.

We found that adolescents with ADHD-I and ADHD-C performed worse than TD in PRS subtests and attention measure, although ADHD presentation specific differences could not be determined. Indeed, ADHD-I and ADHD-C groups had similar profiles of performance, with lower scores in PRS subtests (i.e. C and SS) than TD. These results converge with other studies (e.g. Chhabildas et al., [2001](#_bookmark36); Devena & Watkins, [2012](#_bookmark29); Mayes & Calhoun, [2006](#_bookmark35); Willcutt et al., [2005](#_bookmark18)) in demonstrating relationships between ADHD symptoms and deficits in PRS measures in samples of adolescents with ADHD. In contrast, Kramer et al. ([2020](#_bookmark12)) found more specific associations among PRS deficits and ADHD-I subtype than with ADHD-C subtype. Here, it should also be noted that the PRS deficits showed a notable variation associated with ADHD presentations (Kramer et al., [2020](#_bookmark12)), which may explain our results. Also, unlike Devena and Watkins ([2012](#_bookmark29)) our study did not find group differences between ADHD presentations and TD groups in WISC-IV subtests measuring WM. Our results are consistent with McAuley et al. ([2014](#_bookmark30)) who found that group differences in WM did not remain significant during adolescence and suggested that ADHD children may cope better with WM deficits over time. Additionally, given the recent evidence of relationships between PRS and WM in ADHD, it is striking that in our study we found deficits only in PRS and not in WM (e.g. Jacobson et al., [2011](#_bookmark5); Weigard & Huang-Pollock, [2017](#_bookmark7)). This may be due to the nature of the task we used to measure WM, the age range, or the increased specialization and expansion of brain networks (Spanoudis & Demetriou, [2020](#_bookmark10)). Finally, the effect sizes,

ranging from small to large, obtained for WM and PRS subtests suggest that C and SS distinguish ADHD and TD groups better than DS and LN subtests.

With regard to attention, the ADHD groups showed similar poorer overall perfor- mance in all d2 task parameters. These results corroborate previous reports that some adolescents with ADHD have weaknesses in selective attention (e.g. Greimel et al., [2008](#_bookmark22); Yato et al., [2019](#_bookmark34)). In fact, in our sample, adolescents with ADHD performed worse than TD in processing speed (PS and PSc), concentration (CP) as well as accuracy (E%), and also showed high impulsivity (IMp) and inattention (INa). These results partially coin- cide with those of Blomberg et al. ([2019](#_bookmark0)); using only the PSc parameter as a measure of selective attention, those authors found that ADHD adolescents performed less well than the control group.

Although significant, our results may have been influenced by deficits in the atten- tional domain, common to the two ADHD presentations, due to the attentional demands required to perform the d2 test. The sample size of ADHD-C group with regard to ADHD-I and TD groups may also have had a bearing on the results. However, the effect sizes obtained, ranging from small to large, suggest that all d2 task parameters distin- guished well between ADHD and TD groups.

In agreement with our results, some studies have reported differential poor perfor- mance between ADHD presentations on WM and PRS indexes, and d2 test in children and adolescents (Chhabildas et al., [2001](#_bookmark36); Devena & Watkins, [2012](#_bookmark29); Mayes et al., [2009](#_bookmark24); Willcutt et al., [2005](#_bookmark18), [2012](#_bookmark20); Yato et al., [2019](#_bookmark34)). Thus, our findings and data from other studies (Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72); Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20)) suggest that neuropsychological impairments tend to persist throughout development, although during adolescence the quantitative differences between ADHD presentations are likely to decrease, making discrimination between presentations difficult. Indeed, more pronounced differences for children of age range G1 may reflect a reduction in activity in the cortical regions that underlie performance on WM, PRS and attention tasks, which may be related to a delay in cortical development reported in some studies with samples of ADHD children (Shaw et al., [2007](#_bookmark37)). During adolescence, the development of cortical structures related to executive control, attentional and DMN networks may support a marked improvement in performance on cognitive measures (e.g. Shaw et al., [2006](#_bookmark29), [2013](#_bookmark28)).

Taken together, our results are consistent with previous findings indicating differential deficits in WM, PRS and attention among children and adolescents with ADHD (Chhabildas et al., [2001](#_bookmark36); Devena & Watkins, [2012](#_bookmark29); Mayes & Calhoun, [2006](#_bookmark35); Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20); Yato et al., [2019](#_bookmark34)). In the G1 age range, ADHD groups performed worse than TD in WM and PRS. ADHD-C also performed worse than ADHD-I and TD in the attention measure. In the G2 age range, both ADHD presentations showed similar deficits in PRS subtests and the attention measure with respect to TD. These findings are consistent with some past studies that have reported significant differential relation- ships between developmental maturation trends, ADHD symptoms and continuity and improvement of neuropsychological deficits (e.g. Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72); Seidman, [2006](#_bookmark23)). Likewise, with regard to our second hypothesis, the results show that there were differences in neuropsychological performance in both ADHD presentations according to the age range. Specifically, in the ADHD-I presentation G1 children performed better than their older peers (G2) on two subtests of WISC-IV, one from the WM index (DS) and the other from the PRS index (C) with medium effect sizes. In the d2 attention test,

the older group (G2) showed greater speed and accuracy in information processing, higher concentration, and less inattention than the younger group (G1). In the joint analysis of WM, PRS and attention measures, the medium to large effect sizes we found for DS (i.e. WM) and C (i.e. PRS); and for PS, PSc and CP (i.e. d2 attention test) suggest that these measures are appropriate for identifying significant performance changes in both age groups.

In the ADHD-C group, the older group (G2) performed better than their younger peers (G1) on the WM index of the WISC-IV, while in the PRS index the results varied according to age group and subtest. The effect sizes of the differences ranged from small to medium. In the d2 attention test, the older group (G2) showed greater speed and accuracy in processing the information and greater concentration than the younger group (G1), which also presented a greater number of errors, more inattention and impulsivity than the older group. The effect sizes ranged from large to very large.

In all, differences in WM performance between both age ranges, for ADHD-I and ADHD-C presentations, are consistent with previous findings suggesting that WM deficits are secondary to central ADHD deficits and vary depending on the task (e.g. Halperin et al., [2008](#_bookmark29); Stevens, [2005](#_bookmark14)). However, numerous studies show that WM is the main neuropsychological impairment associated with ADHD (Diamond, [2005](#_bookmark38); Kasper et al., [2012](#_bookmark1); Pievsky & McGrath, [2018](#_bookmark1)). For instance, Diamond ([2005](#_bookmark38)) suggests that difficulties in WM are central in the ADHD-I presentation and may be related to alterations in frontoparietal neural circuits, while in the ADHD-C presentation they may be related to inhibition deficits. Indeed, the relationships between ADHD and WM impairments are probably subject to developmental changes. Certainly, some subcom- ponents of WM (e.g. executive WM) develop continuously and differentially through adolescence (Henry et al., [2020](#_bookmark28)). In particular, the neural networks of the prefrontal cortex associated with verbal WM show functional connectivity patterns of specialization with age, presenting significant refinements in left prefrontal, left parietal and right cerebellar network during adolescence (van den Bosch et al., [2014](#_bookmark39)).

Our results showing performance deficits in PRS subtests for each ADHD presenta-

tion at both age ranges, and data from other studies (e.g. Chhabildas et al., [2001](#_bookmark36); Solanto et al., [2007](#_bookmark4); Willcutt et al., [2005](#_bookmark18)) suggest that processing speed is a significant weakness in children and adolescents with ADHD. The persistence of processing speed impairments, evidenced when comparing both age ranges in each ADHD presentation, is probably related to the common inattentive symptoms underlying both presentations which tend to persist through development (e.g. Wilens & Spencer, [2010](#_bookmark16)). Thus, children and adolescents with the inattentive presentation perform worse than those of the combined presentation in a variety of measures of processing speed besides the WISC-IV PRS index (Goth-Owens et al., [2010](#_bookmark20); Mayes et al., [2009](#_bookmark24); Solanto et al., [2007](#_bookmark4); Wodka et al., [2008](#_bookmark36)). More recently, however, a study with 834 children and adolescents (8 to 16 years) found specific significant relationships between a processing speed measure [Grooved Pegboard Test (GPT; Matthews & Klove, [1964](#_bookmark32))] and both ADHD presentations, although the relationship between processing speed and ADHD-C subtype did not remain constant when inattention symptoms were taken into account (Kramer et al., [2020](#_bookmark12)).

Recent findings suggest that inattention symptoms in ADHD-I are associated with deficits in frontoparietal and cerebellar regions, and aberrant functioning of the CFP cognitive–attention network during childhood and adolescence, which would probably

account for the variety of symptom presentation and the associated cognitive impair- ments such as processing speed problems (Bush, [2010](#_bookmark19); Saad et al., [2020](#_bookmark17)). In addition, difficulties in processing speed related to the immaturity of brain processes (i.e. synaptic pruning and myelination) can contribute, in turn, to vulnerability in the development of other cognitive processes (Demetriou et al., [2008](#_bookmark40); Luna, [2009](#_bookmark41)).

The persistent and variable deficits in both ADHD presentations in almost all para- meters of attention measure is consistent with past studies (e.g. Brodeur & Pond, [2001](#_bookmark14); González-Castro et al., [2015](#_bookmark15); Tucha et al., [2006](#_bookmark23); Wassenberg et al., [2008](#_bookmark2); Yato et al., [2019](#_bookmark34)) which have highlighted that selective attention is seriously impaired in children and adolescents with ADHD. However, it should be noted that the evidence of selective attention deficits in ADHD is not much conclusive (Booth et al., [2005](#_bookmark5); Huang-Pollock et al., [2005](#_bookmark26); Jonkman, [2005](#_bookmark3); Tucha et al., [2006](#_bookmark23)). For instance, Tucha et al. ([2006](#_bookmark23)) found no significant differences between the hyperactive-impulsive presentation (ADHD-HY) and ADHD-C in children and adolescents aged 7 to 14 years on visual scanning task, incompatibility task, and test of crossmodal integration; and Booth et al. ([2005](#_bookmark5)), using a task of visual search in a sample of children aged 9 to 12 years, found only slight differences in performance between ADHD group and controls.

Our finding of improved performance in G2 compared with G1 in almost all d2 task

parameters may be associated with the increases in attentional capacity (Brodeur & Pond, [2001](#_bookmark14); Zhan et al., [2011](#_bookmark35)) and processing speed in adolescence, as well as with the presentation of ADHD symptoms during this period (Faraone et al., [2015](#_bookmark6); Friedman & Rapport, [2015](#_bookmark14); Wassenberg et al., [2008](#_bookmark2)). In particular, the enhanced functional connec- tivity with age in the dorsal attention network (DAN) has been positively associated with selective attention skills in children (Rohr et al., [2018](#_bookmark10)). Therefore, increases in functional connectivity and segregation of the DMN with these networks during adolescence may support both improvements in attentional performance and reductions in hyperactivity/ impulsivity symptoms (Saad et al., [2017](#_bookmark16); Sherman et al., [2014](#_bookmark0)). On the other hand, inattention symptoms are related to abnormal activity within components of attention/ CFP networks in children and adolescents with ADHD (Bush, [2011](#_bookmark27); Saad et al., [2020](#_bookmark17)). In particular, a delay in developmental changes in this network and its associated regions during adolescence, in which significant improvements in the brain’s control networks (i.e. segregation and integration) are known to occur, probably underlies the attentional allocation difficulties associated with ADHD (Fair et al., [2007](#_bookmark0)). Thus, the differences in d2 task parameters that we find between the two age ranges for each ADHD subtype may be related to the specific parameters that were used, since they probably allowed the detection of specific age-related differences. In this regard, Wassenberg et al. ([2008](#_bookmark2)) found significant relationships between some d2 task parameters (i.e. processing speed and impulsivity) and the attention problems subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist in children and adolescents aged 7 to 13 years.

Our third hypothesis, namely that all neuropsychological measures could accurately

predict ADHD presentations and TD in both age groups, was only partially confirmed. The findings showed significant age group differences in only a subset of measures; namely, the number of measures that successfully predicted belonging to a diagnostic group decreased with age, being more numerous for age range G1 (8–12 years) than for age range G2 (13–16 years). Specifically, in the G1, the results showed that PS, E%, DS and SS successfully discriminated both ADHD presentations and TD (explained 92% of

variance), while in age range G2, only E% and C successfully classified ADHD-I, ADHD- C and TD groups (explaining 99% of the variance).

Taken together, these results suggest that WM impairments may be secondary to other main ADHD deficits (Halperin et al., [2008](#_bookmark29); Martinussen et al., [2005](#_bookmark21)), and that PRS and attention poorer performances tend to persist through development, as has been reported in some studies (e.g. Biederman et al., [2009](#_bookmark72)). In addition, ADHD presentations differ in the degree of neuropsychological impairments in late childhood but not in adolescence, when only slight differences were found between the ADHD presentations. Our findings also suggest that WM and PRS subtests and the attention parameters used in this study appear to discriminate ADHD presentations and TD in the group of children aged 8 to 12 years better than in the group of adolescents aged 13 to 16 years, probably due to the development during adolescence of the brain networks that underlie performance on these tasks. Although data documenting differences in ADHD presentation at the level of neurocognitive performance are lacking (Pievsky & McGrath, [2018](#_bookmark1)), our findings agree with certain previous studies reporting more similarities than differences in neurocog- nitive performance in ADHD-I and ADHD-C presentations, which may be associated with age-related change (e.g. Seidman, [2006](#_bookmark23); Walg et al., [2017](#_bookmark26); Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20)).

The present study has several clinical implications. The cognitive and attention mea- sures, though not diagnostic, provide useful information for establishing a profile of abilities and difficulties of the individual assessed, and can help to guide the choice of more targeted intervention strategies and reasonable academic accommodations tailored for each case. The consideration of the WISC-IV GAI as a global measure of cognitive ability when evaluating children and adolescents with ADHD may provide a more accurate approxima- tion than the full intelligence quotient (FSIQ), especially in children. Finally, performance in attention parameters such as the ones used in this study may provide useful information for discriminating between ADHD presentations in children and adolescents. A better understanding of the developmental trajectory and relationships between ADHD presenta- tions and performance on cognitive measures at different ages will allow the development of cognitive screening and neuropsychological assessment protocols able to identify more accurate profiles of cognitive strengths and weaknesses in ADHD presentations

This study has some limitations: first, the results cannot confirm causality relationships, due to the nature of the cross-sectional design used. A longitudinal study of the cognitive processes evaluated as well as the ADHD symptoms could provide more information on the persistence of symptoms and neuropsychological deficits. Second, the size of the sample was not balanced in both age groups for each ADHD subtype and TD; this may have reduced the statistical power, and consequently the reliability of the conclusions. Thus, it will be impor- tant to replicate the findings of this study in a larger ADHD sample including ADHD and TD groups of equal sizes according to age cluster. Likewise, it should be noted that ADHD groups did not have sex-matched TD, due on the one hand to the high rates of referral and diagnosis in boys compared to girls and, on the other, to the participation trends in schools. Thus, further research is required in samples with higher matches between ADHD and TD groups with respect to sex to broaden our understanding of the relationships between ADHD presentations, age-related changes in cognition and gender. Lastly, the ADHD-HY presenta- tion was not considered. Although this presentation has been questioned in terms of its symptom stability (Willcutt et al., [2012](#_bookmark20)), future studies could compare the three ADHD presentations in order to obtain a more complete view of neuropsychological weaknesses in

ADHD associated with age-related cognitive changes. Despite these limitations, the findings of the current study seem to highlight differential relationships between performance on neuropsychological measures, ADHD presentations and age-related cognitive changes.
