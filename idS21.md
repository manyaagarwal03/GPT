**Introduction**
The use of parent and teacher information for diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has evolved considerably over the prior decades. Historically, ADHD eva- luations relied heavily on teacher reports because, in part, many clinicians viewed ADHD as primarily a disorder of school. Medication trials initially focused on medicating children only during school hours and as teachers are typically the only informant available to observe children in school, they were considered by some to be the most desirable informants for monitoring treatment response. Many large-scale studies, however, have shown that children with ADHD are markedly impaired in environments other than school which suggests that many effects of ADHD symptoms could not be detected by teachers  Moreover, while parents do not observe their children during school hours, they typically can provide infor- mation pertaining to school based on their interactions with teachers, reports from their children, and their review of school report cards.

The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 5 edition (DSM-5), defines ADHD with a list of nine hyperactive- impulsive and nine inattentive symptoms, of which children must manifest six, or more, in one or two of the symptoms domains, to a degree that they substantially interfere with functioning in two or more settings to render the diagnosis. DSM-5 states that diagnostic assessments of ADHD cannot be done accurately without consulting informants who have seen the individualâ€™ in multiple â€˜settingsâ€™ and that multiple informants are â€˜beneficialâ€™ though *not required* in formulating the diagnosis. For children, the pertinent informants are <a name="_bookmark4"></a>often interpreted to mean a parent/caregiver and a teacher .

Comments on the use of informant data have also been proffered by professional organizations. The ADHD practice parameter of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) recommends that the parents of patients undergoing evaluations for ADHD â€˜complete one of many standardized behavior rating scalesâ€™ and states that it is â€˜advisable,â€™ though not required, for clinicians to â€˜obtain simi- lar rating scales from the patientâ€™s teachers.â€™ The AACAP prac- tice parameter cautions against formulating a diagnosis only from such rating scales, stating â€˜such rating scales do not by themselves diagnose ADHDâ€™ and in situations in which obtaining teacher reports are not possible â€˜then material from schoolâ€™ may be reviewed in place of a report . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) provides a more gen- eral recommendation that â€˜information should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers and other school and mental health clinicians.â€™ The AAP does not recommend a specific approach, such as a rating scale, academic record review, or interview, to achieve this goal and states â€˜information should be obtained primarily from reports from parents or guardians, teachers, and other school and mental health clinicians involved in the childâ€™s careâ€™. A review of 1098 charts of ADHD patients treated by pediatri- cians found that parent scales were used in the diagnostic <a name="_bookmark9"></a>assessment for 57% of cases and teacher scales in 56% of cases. The DSM, AACAP, and AAP all recognize the value of collecting information from parents and teachers, but pro- vide no clear guidance about how to approach situations in which teacher reports are unavailable or difficult to obtain, and how best to integrate parent-teacher reports when both are available.

The ambiguity of current recommendations reflects the state of the empirical literature. Early studies of parent and teacher reports focused on the degree to which these infor- mants agreed on the presence of individual symptoms. A substantial body of literature has shown that there is a rela- tively poor correlation between parents and teachers on the individual symptoms of ADHD (mean *r* values = 0.2, 0.31, 0.19, 0.2, 0.25). These findings remain true even when asses- sing cross-informant agreement for ADHDâ€™s two symptoms domains (HA mean *r* = 0.39, 0.19, 0.41, 0.29, 0.27) (IA mean *r* = 0.25, 0.19, 0.22, 0.22, 0.34). In contrast to the poor correlation between parents and teachers on the individual <a name="_bookmark12"></a>symptoms of ADHD, the informant agreement on the ADHD diagnosis is relatively high.

Despite strong evidence of negative outcomes including social, academic, and occupational impairment, increased risk of co-morbid psychiatric illness, and later life substance use disorders far less is known about the predictive valid- ity of the different informants or combinations of informants. These combinations have mostly been assessed comparing four options: parent only, teacher only, parent *and* teacher (the â€˜ANDâ€™ rule), and parent *or* teacher (the â€˜ORâ€™ rule). A number of studies have found parents as good, or better, than teachers at predicting treatment response and comor- bid mood disturbance while others showed teachers to be better at predicting poor peer socialization and later life crim- inal behavior.

In clinical practice, the ADHD diagnosis is sometimes made with a single informant report. Parents reports are typically readily available, and at times used in the absence of a teacher report, when formulating the diagnosis. In situations in which a teacher report is also obtained, it is typically acquired with some effort on the part of the clinician and parent. The first practice of using only a parent report leaves some uncer- tainty as to whether the patient satisfied the diagnostic criteria for ADHD. The second, of obtaining a teacher report in addi- tion to that of a parent, necessarily delays making a diagnosis and initiating an appropriate treatment to manage the patientâ€™s symptoms.

As the above review indicates, the answer to the question â€˜Do parents and teachers agree on the diagnosis of ADHD?â€™ depends upon whether one refers to individual symptoms, the symptoms within each domain specifically, total symptom counts, the diagnostic construct, or a derivative feature such as medication response, comorbid illness, or later life failure. While this work has usefully documented the range of parent- teacher agreement, it does not speak directly to two key

clinical questions: (1) is one informant more accurate than the other and (2) should one seek out two informants and, if so, how should that information be integrated? This informa- tion is essential for clarifying the relative value of parent and teacher reports and methods of combining these reports. To address this issue, we conducted a literature review of studies that have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of parent and teacher reports by assessing their sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive power (NPV) and positive predictive power (PPV) as predictors of gold standard ADHD diagnoses. In this article, we use the term â€˜gold standardâ€™ to refer to a diagnostic interview administered by a clinician our by a trained interviewer.

**Methods**
A PubMed literature search identified ADHD parent-teacher informant studies that met the following criteria: (1) assessed individuals diagnosed with ADHD, (2) included a parent-based informant diagnosis, (3) included a teacher-based informant diagnosis, and (4) included a gold standard diagnosis of ADHD by a mental health clinician. We used the following search algorithm: parent-teacher ADHD (agree OR disagree OR dis- agreement OR: agreement OR concordance OR informant OR validity OR reliability). We reviewed studies generated from this search and only included those reports that were available in the English language and were published as articles in peer- reviewed journals. We only selected studies that presented the PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of each informant with respect to a gold standard diagnostic interview. In addition to the above metrics, we extracted the following, when available, from the selected studies: sample size, percentage dropout, mean age, percent of participants that were male, the approach to diagnostic evaluation/gold standard (interview type), the predictor utilized, geographic region in which the study was conducted, and sample type (enriched for ADHD vs. selected from the community).

To assess the effects of informant and potential confounds on sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV, we first transformed these proportions with the logit transformation and then used them as dependent variables in regression models. These models were weighted by the number of participants in the study providing the accuracy statistics. Each study provided more than one assessment of diagnostic accuracy due to the use of multiple samples, different informants or algorithm, or different cutpoints on predictors. To address <a name="_bookmark18"></a>this lack of statistical independence between data points, we <a name="_bookmark19"></a>used robust standard errors. All analyses used STATA 14.0.

**Results**
The initial search yielded 234 candidate articles of which eight met our inclusion criteria. [Figure 1 ] describes our selection of studies using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) format. The eight studies are described in [Table 1]. They were published between 2004 and 2015 with sample sizes ranging from 151 to 1221. The percentage dropout, reported in five of the eight studies, ranged from 2.1% to 63.9%. The mean age of participants, reported in seven of the eight studies, ranged from 7.4 to 10\.9 years of age. The gender makeup, described in seven studies, ranged from 42% to 100% male. All studies used either a structured or semi-structured clinical interview for their gold standard diagnostic assessment. The measures used to collect parent and teacher data for predicting gold standard diagnoses included the Vanderbilt ADHD diagnostic rating scale (VADRS), ADHD rating scale (ARS), strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ), impairment rating scale (IRS), global assessment scale (GAS), Connors child behavioral checklist (CBCL), comprehensive parent rating scale (CPRS), teacher report form (TRF), Connors teacher rating scale (CTRS), disruptive behavior disorder rating scale (DBD), and the behavioral assessment system for children (BASC). The studies were conducted in five nations and three regions within the United States. Four of the studies selected partici- pants from community samples; the selected participants from samples enriched for ADHD (e.g. clinical samples). [Figure 2a ] plots the sensitivity versus the false positive rate for each informant group relative to the gold standard diag- nosis. The diagonal line is the line of zero accuracy (LZA). The accuracy of a point increases with its distance from the LZA. From [Figure 2a ]it is clear that the AND rule lowers the false positive rate at the expense of reducing sensitivity and the OR rule has the reverse effect. The figure does not suggest any clear superiority of parent or teacher reports when compared with one another. [Figure 2b ] plots the results for each study. We see clear differences among studies with the best results being obtained by Fabiano et al. and Pineda et al. and the worst results being reported by Tripp et al. and Park et al. 

The studies employed various means of establishing their gold standard ADHD diagnoses and corresponding parent, teacher, or combined diagnosis. Fabiano et al.  used the impairment rating scale (IRS) as the predictor. Their gold standard was a semi-structured interview employing the diag- nostic interview schedule for children (DISC) and the SNAP-IV with a positive symptom established if endorsed by both informants. Wolraich et al. used a comprehensive parent inter- view employing the DISC as the gold standard diagnosis. 

Their predictor was the VADRS. Pineda et al. used a comprehensive diagnostic interview as a gold standard. The predictor used was the BASC. Tripp et al. used a semi- structured clinical interview of both the parent and teacher as their gold standard. The predictor consisted of the combined score from the CBCL and CPRS for parents and the TRF and CTRS for teachers. Shemmassian and Lee used the DISC for gold standard diagnoses. The predictor was the DBD. Shemmassian and Lee used a clinical interview employing the DISC as a gold standard. They used a modified DISC as the predictor for parents and the DBD for teachers. Park et al. used the DISC as a gold standard. The predictor was the ARS. Johnson et al. used a semi-structured diagnostic interview and telephone report of the parent and teacher, respectively, as their gold standard diagnosis. The SDQ was used as the predictor.

All eight studies provided a parent and a teacher infor- mant while three also assessed the â€˜*parent AND teacher*â€™ rule and two assessed the â€˜*parent OR teacher*â€™ rule. Four studies provided an AND rule, one by considering a symptom posi- tive only if endorsed by both informants  and the others by considering a diagnosis only if the score was reported to be abnormal by both informants. The OR rule was provided in two of the studies, one by deeming a symp- tom positive if endorsed by either informant, and the other by considering a diagnosis if the score of either infor- mant report was abnormal. The eight studies provided data from 11samples. Because several informant rules were applied to the 11 samples and some authors examined multi- ple cutpoints on their predictor, a total of 70 data points were available for analysis. We adjusted for the non-indepen- dence of data points within samples as described in â€˜Methodsâ€™ section. [Table 2 ] presents the means of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for each of the informants and combinations of informants. For sensitivity, the effect of informant was statisti- cally significant (*F*<sub>3,7</sub> = 35.7. *p* = 0.0001). Four pairwise compar- isons were statistically significant: â€˜*or vs and*â€™, â€˜*parent vs and*â€™, â€˜*teacher vs and*â€™, and â€˜*parent vs or*â€™ (*t*<sub>7</sub> = 9.5 *p* < 0.001, *t*<sub>7</sub> = 5.8 *p* = 0.001, *t*<sub>7</sub> = 3.2 *p* = 0.02, and *t*<sub>7</sub> = âˆ’ 2.6 *p* = 0.04, all others *p* > 0.10). The â€˜*OR rule*â€™ had the highest mean sensitivity, followed by the *parent*, then the *teacher*, and lastly the â€˜*AND rule*â€™ ([Table 2]. Analyses of potential confounds found male gender and date of publication to be statistically significant (*F*<sub>1,6</sub> = 11.9, *p* = 0.01, *F*<sub>1,6</sub> = 10.8, *p* = 0.02, *F*<sub>1,7</sub> = 11.09, *p* < 0.0127). The effect of informant on sensitivity remained significant after correcting for the significant confounds (*F*<sub>3,6</sub> = 9.9, *p* = 0.01).

We found that informant significantly predicted specificity (*F*<sub>1,7</sub> = 8.1 *p* = 0.01). Only the â€˜teacher *vs AND rule*â€™ pairwise comparison was significant (*t*<sub>7</sub> = 2.5 *p* = 0.04, all others *p* > 0.05). As for confounds, sample type and percentage dropout were significantly associated with specificity such that specificity was greater for enriched samples over commu- nity samples and for studies having a lower dropout rate (*F*<sub>1,7</sub> = 9.38 *p* = 0.02; *F*<sub>1,6</sub> = 43.8 *p* = 0.003). All other potential confounds did not significantly alter specificity (all *p* > 0.12). The effect of informant on specificity remained significant after correcting for the significant confounds (*F*<sub>3,7</sub> = 31.3, *p* = 0.0002)

When evaluating PPV the effect of informant was not sig- nificant (*F*<sub>3,7</sub> = 0.99 *p =* 0.45). For NPV, the effect of informant was significant (*F*<sub>3,7</sub> = 24.7 *p* = .0004) with pairwise compar- isons showing significant differences between the â€˜*OR rule vs AND rule*â€™ and the â€˜*parent vs AND rule*â€™ but not the others (*t*<sub>7</sub> = 2.7 *p* = 0.03, *t*<sub>7</sub> = 4.9 *p* = 0.002, all others *p* > 0.14). The â€˜*OR rule*â€™ displayed the greatest mean NPV, followed by the *parent*, the *teacher*, and lastly the â€˜*AND rule*â€™ ([Table 2]. The only confound predictive of NPV was age (*t*<sub>7</sub> = 4.1 *p* = 0.006; all others *p* > 0.14)

**Discussion**
Results from our review show that the literature on the subject is very small and that few studies assessed the accuracy of parent or teacher diagnoses of ADHD in reference to a gold standard diagnosis.

Our most important finding is the lack of difference in the accuracy of parents and teachers as reporters of gold standard diagnoses. This is seen in the means accuracy statistics in [Table 2]. Consistent with this finding, teacher and parent reports have also been shown to be similar for assessing response to medication, duration of response, degree of improvement, and doseâ€“response relationships.

These means, however, obscure a good deal of variability between studies. Inspection of [Figure 2b ] shows three samples with fairly large differences in accuracy favoring parents over teachers and one favoring teachers over parents. Those studies showing the highest levels of accuracy show very similar results for parents and teachers. From [Table 2 ] we see that these two studies had the highest fraction of male subjects and both used enriched samples. These features, which we found to predict better sensitivity, are likely to select ADHD patients with higher levels of sever- ity, which may explain the better accuracy results from those two studies. Arguing against this idea are the data from Tripp et al., which show a low level of accuracy despite using an enriched sample with a high proportion of male subjects.

When evaluating the clinical implications of these findings, we refer to the typical clinical context where a parent report is readily available and one wonders if a teacher report would be worthwhile. Some direction is given by the expected effects we observed for the AND and OR rules. Compared to single informants, the AND rule decreased both sensitivity and the false positive rate whereas the OR rule increased both of these measures. Because the only value of the AND rule is to decrease false positives, it should only be used when the clinician is concerned that the parental diagnosis may be false. The OR rule is useful when one is concerned with low sensivity. This idea is consistent with the clinical approach sug- gested by Power et al. who suggested that one obtain a teacher report (i.e. use the AND rule) when skeptical of a positive report by the parent or in situations in which the parent remains equivocal about the childâ€™s symptoms or impairments. The AND rule would also be appropriate for parents who are unreliable reporters due to intelligence, men- tal state or psychopathology or for parental reports that just exceed the threshold of diagnosis. How common such scenar- ios are will depend on the clinical setting. Under the OR rule, clinicians would not seek teacher diagnoses when parental diagnoses were positive. Teacher diagnoses would only be sought when an evaluation raised concerns about low sensi- tivity. One example is when the parent provides data that just miss the symptomatic or age at onset criteria for a child that is massively impaired.

These considerations suggest that teacher reports will not be *routinely* essential when parent reports are available. Consistent with this conclusion, Biederman et al. reported that when a parent report indicated a positive diag- nosis of ADHD, the teacher report confirmed the diagnosis in the large majority of cases. Although we conclude that teacher reports are not *essential* for diagnosing ADHD or monitoring treatment response, the use of teacher reports for concerns beyond the diagnosis of ADHD must be considered. Formulating psychosocial treatment plans, and targeting trou- ble areas present only in the school environment may benefit from teacher reports about school-based behaviors. Teacher <a name="_bookmark35"></a>reports are clearly essential for school-based treatment pro- grams.

Our study has several limitations. The small number of studies reviewed, eight meeting our inclusion criteria, limited the amount of data available for analysis. There was also a substantial diversity between the studies reviewed with varia- tions in participant age, gender, percentage fallout, sampling, and region. Despite these limitations, which likely decreased our power, we were able to detect significant effects of infor- mants and of potential confounds. In all studies, parents pro- vided both the interview data for the gold standard assessment and a parent reported rating scale. Thus, it is possible that measures of parent to gold standard agreement are inflated. We could also not fully address the value of the AND and OR rules given the limited amount of data.

**Conclusion**
Despite these limitations, our review has clarified the relative utility of parent and teacher reports. In contrast to claims that parents reports are better than teacher reports, or vice versa, our analyses found no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy between informants. Given these findings, along with the typical clinical context in which parent reports are available, we provide a framework for deciding when the additional burden of acquiring teacher reports is warranted. That said, the small number of studies available on this key clinical issue calls for additional research.
