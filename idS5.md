**Abstract**
Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder with heterogeneous symptoms, subtypes, and cognitive deficits. Cognitive deficits are central to ADHD pathophysiology and one potential source of heterogeneity in ADHD. Subtype-specific cognitive correlates are not, however, well-studied. We explored cognitive correlates of ADHD *subtypes* based on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) scores. We also assessed subtype-specific self-esteem rating in ADHD subtypes and explored its association with cognitive correlates.
**Methods**
One hundred thirty-nine children with ADHD (80.6% boy, 19.4% girl) were categorized into the predominantly ‚Äúhyperactive (ADHD-H)‚Äù, ‚Äúinattentive (ADHD-I)‚Äù and ‚Äúcombined (ADHD-C)‚Äù subtype based on their symptoms and scores on the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) and Conners Parent-Rating Scale (CPRS-RS). They were then individually administrated the WISC-IV and completed a self-esteem inventory. Group differences in the WISC-IV indices and their predictability in discriminating ADHD subtypes were analyzed.
**Result**
 We found a *quantitative* differentiation of cognitive abilities among ADHD subtypes with ‚Äúworking memory‚Äù as the most compromised cognitive domain. ADHD-I had the poorest cognitive profile while ADHD-H scored highest in all cognitive domains. Importantly, cognitive abilities were negatively correlated with inattention and positively correlated with hyperactive symptoms. Moreover, self-esteem ratings were positively correlated with the cognitive domains and were rated differently based on the subtypes. ADHD-H, with the highest cognitive strength, reported the highest level of self-esteem among all subtypes.
**Conclusions**
 ADHD subtype-specific symptoms, cognitive deficits, and self-esteem problems should be considered for precise diagnosis and effective and personalized treatment in ADHD in light of further supporting evidence and assessments. Cognitive interventions might be more compatible with and effective in inattentive and combined subtypes of ADHD. Working memory improving-based interventions can benefit all ADHD subtypes. A supportive educational system in school and providing adjunct supportive interventions should be considered for children with ADHD as well.

**Background**
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder with *heterogeneous* symptoms, subtypes and treatment response. A precise description of the pathophysiology underlying ADHD is difficult due to its neuropsychological heterogeneity and substantial overlap between ADHD and typically de- veloping children. Cognitive deficits, especially execu- tive dysfunctions, are central to ADHD psychopathology and among the primary treatment targets by pharma- cological and novel treatment approaches. These cognitive deficits are also heterogeneous in ADHD and thus individual differences in cognitive profile should be considered as well. One aspect of heterogeneity in ADHD symptoms and cognitive deficits is its subtypes which includes a predominantly hyperactive (ADHD- H), inattentive (ADHD-I), and combined (ADHD-C) sub- type. These subtypes are discerned from each other by the presence of specific symptoms, however, little is known about neuro-functional and cognitive differenti- ation of ADHD subtypes.

Furthermore, it is still elusive whether a specific sub- type is critical to consider when examining treatment ef- fects. For example, a recent study suggests that the effectiveness of neurofeedback treatment on the execu- tive functioning of children with ADHD is subtype- specific. ADHD-I showed improved performance on the execution of an action in an experimental Go/NoGo task while the ADHD-C showed improved ability to withhold a prepotent response tendency in NoGo trials. Recent reviews of non-invasive brain stimulation studies in ADHD also suggests that the efficacy of the treatment could be different in ADHD subtypes. Identifying subtype-specific profiles in ADHD, especially cognitive profile, is thus a timely and important topic in the  field and is in line with recent findings from neuroimaging studies indicating subtype-specific pattern of activity in different brain regions.

Previous studies showed that the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) provides a relatively compre- hensive profile of cognitive  strengths  and  weaknesses and is commonly used for cognitive evaluation in the clinical pediatric population. Application of WISC in ADHD also confirms that it reliably differentiates be- tween ADHD patients and healthy controls. Moreover, it can provide knowledge about specific cog- nitive strengths and weaknesses in ADHD, used in designing therapeutic and educational  interventions, and employed as a diagnostic marker in children with ADHD. However, the  cognitive  strengths and weaknesses of ADHD *subtypes* are not adequately explored in the previous studies in ADHD while several neuropsychological distinctions in ADHD subtypes (es- pecially ADHD-I vs ADHD-C) have been identified.

Similar to subtype-specific cognitive deficits, self- esteem and social functioning  in  ADHD  subtypes  are not well-studied and the available studies are even more limited. Lower ratings of self-esteem in ADHD patients compared to the healthy control, regardless of ADHD subtypes, have been reported in previous  studies. These studies also showed that the treatment of ADHD symptoms was associated with the improvement of self-esteem scores suggesting  that  self-esteem and ADHD symptoms (including cognitive deficits) are relevant for treatment efficacy. Nevertheless, subtypes- specific ratings of self-esteem and its association with cognitive deficits require further investigation.

The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to ex- plore cognitive correlates of ADHD subtypes based on the WISC-IV scores in a relatively large sample size (*n* = 139). We also performed a discriminative analysis to evaluate if the cognitive profile of each ADHD subtype can predict group membership. We further assessed the level of self-esteem in each ADHD subtypes to  deter- mine any associations between subtype-specific cognitive correlates and self-esteem ratings in ADHD.

**Methods**
Participants

One hundred thirty-nine children with  ADHD  (80.6% boy, 19.4% girl, mean age = 8.20 ¬± 2.50), referred to the Fatemi Hospital at Ardabil University of Medical Sciences, were included in this study. The data was col- lected in the child psychiatry division of the  hospital which is dedicated to the diagnosis  and  treatment  of child and adolescence psychiatric disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. ADHD, autism, learning disabilities). Participants‚Äô recruitment took place from mid-2017 until the end of 2019. The inclusion cri- teria were: (1) ADHD diagnosis according to the DMS-5 criteria by a licensed psychiatrist and a child psycholo- gist, (2) moderate to severe score  in  the  parent  or teacher version of the Conners‚Äô Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) in addition to an independent diagnosis made by psychiatrist/psychologist, (3) being 6‚Äì15 years old, (4) and no current and history of psychiatric, neurodevelop- mental disorders and chronic physical illness. All partici- pants were on medication  treatment when  recruited for the experiment however, there were prevented from the medication 24 h before testing to ensure that WISC-IV performance was not affected by medication as  sug- gested by previous studies [[21], [29], [30]]. The study was performed according to the latest version of the Declar- ation of Helsinki and approved by the ethics committee of the local University. Participants‚Äô parents were instructed about experimental procedures and gave their written informed consent. Demographic information is summarized in Table 1.

**measures**

*Kiddie schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL)*

The K-SADS-PL (3) is a semi-structured interview for assessing psychiatric diagnoses in children and adoles- cents from 6 to 18 years old. It assesses the  present, history of psychiatric disorders, and the severity of symptoms  based  on  the  DSM-IV.  The  K-SADS-PL-P is especially sensitive at diagnosing patients with ADHD, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, general anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress dis- order, and substance use disorder. The test-retest reli- ability and kappa coefficients  are  reported  excellent for the present and lifetime diagnosis of major psychi- atric disorders. A native-language version of the  scale used in this study with good-to-excellent concurrent validity in  diagnosing current major disorders. The Kappa agreements for most diagnoses  are  higher than 0.4 and the test-retest reliability is 0.87.

*Conners*‚Äô *parent rating scale-revised: short version (CPRS- RS)*

The revised version of Conners‚Äô Rating Scale [[32]] has three forms; parent, teacher and  self-report  form  and each form has a short and long version. The CPRS-RS used in this study contains 27 items and measures symp- toms in four subscales: 1) oppositional subscale, 2) in- attention, 3) hyperactive/impulsive, and 4) ADHD Index. Each item is presented in a 4-point Likert scale ranging from Not True at All (1) to Very Much True (4). The cut-off point for clinical diagnosis of ADHD is reported differently and we used scores higher than 59 based on CPRS-RS guidelines which is indicative of ‚Äúhigher aver- age score‚Äù. The items are based on DSM diagnostic cri- teria for ADHD. Psychometric properties of the CPRS- RS are reported adequate as demonstrated by good in- ternal reliability coefficients, high test-retest  reliability and effective discriminative power. The psychomet- ric properties of the native version of the CPRS are reported good and reliable and demonstrated to be use- ful in discriminating children with ADHD from typically developing individuals.


*Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC-IV)*

The WISC-IV is an individually administered test battery that assesses intelligence in school-aged children (from 6 to 16 years of age) [[35], [36]]. The 4th edition included 10 subtests yielding to four index scores that combine into one FSIQ. The index scores include (1) Verbal Compre- hension Index (VCI), (2) Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI), (3) Work Memory Index (WMI), and (4) Process- ing Speed Index (PSI). Analyzing WISC-IV profiles are suggested as useful differential diagnosis tools, particu- larly in distinguishing between ‚Äúreal ADHD‚Äù and pseudo-ADHD.

*Coopersmith self-esteem (CSE) inventory*

The 58-items CSE with high reliability of 0.88 and valid- ity was used to measure the level of self-esteem in participants. CSE is one of the most commonly-used measure of self-esteem in healthy and clinical popula- tions. In CSE, self-esteem total score ranges from 0 to 50. Scores higher than 25 indicate high levels  and scores lower than 25 indicate a low level of total self- esteem score. The total self-esteem score is the com- pound score consisting of four subscales in including global self-esteem, social self-esteem, family self-esteem, and educational/professional self-esteem. These sub- scales have a separate score and combination of them represents total self-esteem score. The CSE thus mea- sures self-esteem as a global score but it yields a specific score for each subscale as well. The CSE has reliability and validity and the Cronbach‚Äôs Œ± coefficient and split-half reliability are reported to be 0.83 and 0.84, re- spectively.

**Procedure**
139 children in this study were consecutive  referrals to our child psychiatry hospital who were diagnosed with ADHD. After we received institutional review board ap- proval, children with ADHD and their parents were interviewed by a psychiatrist based on the CPRS-RS and K-SADS-PL and were categorized into ADHD-I, ADHD- H, and ADHD-C accordingly. Twenty-four hours before the testing day, the patients that were on medication stopped taking the medication. They were then adminis- trated the WISC-IV and completed the self-esteem in- ventory. All tests were conducted in the same testing room. The order of tests was randomized.

**Statistical analysis**

We used IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for data analysis. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni-corrected t-tests were applied to examine group differences for the major WISC-IV in- dices, including the VCI, PRI, WMI, PSI, and the full- scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ). It is of note that the potential covariate effect of age was controlled as FSIQ and indices scores are estimated  by  age-scaled  scores and thus age was not entered a covariate in the analysis. A separate similar ANOVA was conducted on the rating of self-esteem  domains. Our data met  the ANOVA lin- ear assumptions and Leven‚Äôs test was used to examine the homogeneity of variances. Additionally, we per- formed a discriminant analysis to explore whether WISC-IV indices scores, as predictor variables, can pre- dict grouping of ADHD patients into ADHD-I, ADHD- H, and ADHD-C subtypes. Correlational analyses be- tween the outcome measures were calculated using the Pearson correlation (two-tailed). A significance level of *p* < .05 was used for all statistical comparisons.

**Results**

**Cognitive profile differences in ADHD subtypes**

The results of ANOVA showed significant differences between ADHD subtypes that were revealed in the FSIQ and all indices of VCI, PRI, WMI,  and  PSI  (Fig.  [1], Table [2]. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc t-tests revealed that ADHD-I, compared to the ADHD-H, scored lower in the FSIQ (*t* = 4.21, *p* < 0.001) and all indices of VCI (*t* = 4.20, *p* < 0.001), PRI (*t* = 2.85, *p* = 0.013), WMI (*t* = 2.90, *p* = 0.011), and PSI (*t* = 4.84, *p* < 0.001). Moreover, ADHD-I scores in  the VCI (*t* = 2.59, *p* = 0.028)  and PSI (*t* = 2.67, *p* = 0.023) indices were significantly lower than ADHD-C. No significant difference  between  ADHD-H vs ADHD-C was found in any  of the indices. In sum, WMI was the weakest (regardless of ADHD  subtype), VCI was the strongest index, and FSIQ score  was  3 points lower than 90 (Fig. [1].

**Discriminant analysis and predictive ability**

We used discriminant analysis to see whether subtests scores of the WISC-IV, as predictor variables, can pre- dict grouping of ADHD patients into ADHD-I, ADHD- H, and ADHD-C. Results of the discriminant analysis showed a significant function (*p* = 0.001) that accounted for 90.7% of the discriminative ability of the WISC-IV subtests in predicting ADHD group membership (Chi- square = 113.27, df = 20, *p* = 0.001). The canonical correl- ation between predictor variables and grouping was R = 0.727. Correct grouping of the function for ADHD-I, ADHD-H, and ADHD-C was 57.1, 84.5, and 45.5% respectively. Moreover, the discriminant function could correctly classify 68.3% of the  individuals or identified the group to which the individuals belong (Table [3]. Finally, we calculated coefficients of the WISC-IV subtests, which can specify the contribution of each WISC-IV subtests to distinguishing or discriminating ADHD sub- types. The vocabularies (0.508), similarities (0.364) and symbol search (0.258) subscales had the most significant correlation with a discriminant function (Table [3]).

**Self-esteem rating**

Results of the ANOVA showed significant differences be- tween ADHD subtypes in the global and total self-esteem rating and a significant main effect of subtypes was found (Table [2]. Bonferroni-corrected post hoc analysis revealed that ADHD-H had a significantly higher *total* self-esteem compared with ADHD-I (*t* = 7.39, *p* < 0.001) and ADHD- C (*t* = 8.16, *p* < 0.001). Similarly, ADHD-H patients had a significantly higher *global* self-esteem compared with ADHD-I (*t* = 3.97, *p* < 0.001) and ADHD-C (*t* = 5.32, *p* <0\.001). No significant differences were found in the subdo- mains of self-esteem between the groups (Fig. [2].

**Correlational analyses**

Cognitive indices of the WICS-IV were positively corre- lated with ratings of self-esteem indicating that cognitive deficits were associated with lower self-esteem. This positive correlation was observed in all of the WICS-IV indices (VCI, PRI, WMI, PSI, FSIQ) and all of the self- esteem domains except for the family self-esteem (Table [4]. Furthermore, we found interesting  associa- tions between the WICS-IV indices and attentional vs hyperactivity scores. Cognitive deficits were negatively correlated with attentional symptoms which means that more attentional deficits were associated with poor per- formance on the WICS-IV indices. In contrast, perform- ance on the WICS-IV indices was positively correlated with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (Table [4]. This pattern of association is in line with the quantitative dif- ference between the ADHD-I and ADHD-H with better scores on WICS-IV indices for the latter group. Finally, all of the self-esteem domains, except for the family self- esteem, were negatively correlated with inattention symptoms but not hyperactivity.

**Discussion**

In the present study, we explored subtype-specific cogni- tive correlates in 139 children with ADHD based on the WISC-IV. We also assessed self-esteem ratings in ADHD subtypes. Our results show that ADHD-I has the most im- paired cognitive profile among all ADHD subtypes and is mostly discriminated with ADHD-H, with the least im- paired cognitive functions. Our results further suggest a quantitative differentiation of cognitive profiles among ADHD subtypes with working memory as the most com- promised cognitive domain with the lowest value in ADHD-I. Moreover, we found a converging pattern of ADHD subtype-specific differences in self-esteem rating with a significantly higher-rated self-esteem in ADHD-H compared to ADHD-I and ADHD-C.

With regard to  subtype-specific  cognitive  correlates, we found a quantitative differentiation of cognitive pro- files among ADHD subtypes regardless of WISC-IV do- mains in line with previous works. This suggests that all ADHD subtypes display similar cogni- tive deficits with WM as the most impaired  domain but the extent to which ADHD symptoms are close to in- attentive vs hyperactive subtype determines the level of impairment. This  is  in  line with the  results  of  Roberts et al. (2017) that found group difference in executive dysfunction of ADHD subtypes based on gradations of EF impairments. The group with poor set-shifting/speed, close to ADHD-I subtype in our study, was the most se- verely impaired one and the intact  task  performance group (close to ADHD-H in our study) was relatively unimpaired in executive functioning  task  performance. This finding is in line with a previous study based on a sample size of 1038  children  with  ADHD  that found those with cognitive subtype (close to ADHD-I in our sample) exhibit information processing deficits (PSI index in our sample) compared to subtypes with more predominately behavioral problems (ADHD-H in our sample). This study also reported that ADHD sub- types can be described on a continuum of severity which is supported by our findings.An important aspect of our findings was that WM is the poorest cognitive domain in all ADHD subtypes especially in the ADHD-I. Previous studies using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale in both children and adults with ADHD, regardless of subtype, showed that working memory and processing speed are usually among the most impaired domains in ADHD patients compared to healthy controls. A recent study that comprehensively ex- amined executive functioning heterogeneity in pediatric ADHD using neuropsychological battery also found a positive association between impaired working memory and exhibiting higher ADHD symptoms. Our results are generally in line with these studies by showing WM as the most impaired domain in all *subtypes*. The quantita- tive pattern observed in cognitive profiles of ADHD sub- types might also suggest that WM is the underlying basic executive function that affects performance on other cognitive domains. More importantly, this is in line with a recently introduced model of ADHD psychopath- ology, which proposes WM deficits as a major risk factor in ADHD and implies that WM is probably one of the core cognitive deficits in the pathophysiology of all ADHD subtypes, and could be a reasonable target for ADHD treatment. Novel treatment approaches, such as non-invasive brain stimulation that have been promisingly used in ADHD also target WM as one of the core deficits in ADHD. In addition to the cognitive correlates, we found a subtype-specific pattern in self-esteem ratings with ADHD-H reporting a higher level of global and total self-esteem compared to other subtypes. Previous studies documented social impairment in ADHD and empha- sized on the need for further investigation of subtype- specific social deficits in ADHD. In line with this, our results showed that self-esteem ratings of  children with ADHD follow the same quantitative pattern of re- sponse in cognitive correlates. In other words, those sub- types with more severe cognitive deficits had the lowest level of self-esteem as well which was supported by the negative correlation between  the  self-esteem  domains and cognitive correlates. The association of subtype- specific cognitive correlates and self-esteem rating  is novel and not well-studies by previous works but is in line with studies showing an association between self- esteem and cognitive performance.

One important point to be noted here is the distribu- tion of ADHD subtypes in our sample. Participants with the ADHD-H subtype constitute the majority of our sample (51.1%) while in other studies, the ratio of ADHD-I and ADHD-C has been relatively  reported higher. One potential reason could be that the majority of the sample were boys with ADHD who rela- tively have a higher ADHD-H subtype ratio than females although results have been mixed and some studies show no gender difference between ADHD sub- types. Furthermore, the  distribution  of  ADHD  subtype in the Iranian sample does not follow those of western countries [[60]] and this could be another reason for such a subtype-specific ratio in our sample. Finally, different ratings of symptoms and diagnosis strategy, which can be affected by cultural  factors too, could  also contribute to higher ADHD-H ratio in our sample.

Taken together, the results of the present study show that there is subtype-specific cognitive profile, measured by WISC-IV, in ADHD confirming a cognitive hetero- geneity in ADHD in line with recent evidence. ADHD subtype, if is reliably identified and existed, is an important contributing factor not only to cognitive strength/weakness but also self-esteem ratings. These re- sults have implications for diagnosis precision and per- sonalized treatment in ADHD patients. For instance, cognitive interventions are among the major treatments in ADHD which might be more compatible with and ef- fective in ADHD-I or ADHD-C subtypes due to more severe cognitive weaknesses. Similarly, social interven- tions and self-esteem can be more effectively addressed in the subtypes with lower self-esteem ratings. The need for the individualized and personalized treatment ap- proach in ADHD is supported  more  than  before  from the neurobiological differences of ADHD subtypes and is required due to the heterogeneity of ADHD symptoms.

It is necessary to note that although the focus of this study is on subtype-specific differences in cognitive and self-esteem profiles of children with ADHD, such sub- type specification is not confirmed in all studies. Some studies have shown an instability or  shift  in  subtypes over years in children with ADHD. Findings of these studies indicate that ADHD subtypes  distinction may not provide a reliable approach for long-term diag- nosis and treatment in children with ADHD, especially when the subtype diagnosis is not validated via different measures and assessments. Nevertheless, finding from neuroimaging studies that partially supports a subtype- specific involvement of brain region in ADHD [[13], [14]] is needed in the future studies along with other neuro- psychological measures to validate subtype-specific diag- nose in children with ADHD.

The following limitations should be considered. First, we did not have a control group consisting of typically developing children because the purpose of  this  study was  to  determine subtype-specific cognitive differences in ADHD. Nevertheless, comparison with typically de- veloping children can also reveal insightful differences of children with ADHD compared to their healthy peers. Second, because we did not intend to focus on gender differences, the number of girls in the study was small and need to be explored in larger samples. Third, the WISC-IV indices might not examine specific aspects of cognition in ADHD and cognitive profile of ADHD sub- types needs to be explored with more specific cognitive measures of executive functions, such as cold vs hot ex- ecutive functions [[63]]. Finally, the concept of subtype distinction among children with ADHD is a controver- sial topic and may not be consistent across the life span which needs to be considered in interpreting the results of this study. These limitations notwithstanding, our ADHD sample were recruited from clinical  settings, rather than community, and could have clinical implications.

**Conclusions**
We found a subtype-specific quantitative difference in cognitive correlates and self-esteem ratings of children with ADHD which can be considered for precise diagno- sis and individualized interventions. Further assessments and neuroimaging findings in support of a subtype- specific distinction are needed. Our findings also support the notion that ADHD is characterized by  neurocogni- tive heterogeneity. Cognitive interventions might be more compatible with and effective in inattentive and combined subtypes of ADHD but working memory improving-based interventions can benefit all subtypes. Association of cognitive performance and self-esteem ratings indicates the importance of educational support system in school for children with ADHD and/or pro- viding adjunct supportive interventions in addition to cognitive ones.
