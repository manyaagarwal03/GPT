Attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms in two main domains including inattentiveness and hyperactivity–impulsivity. One well-documented theory of ADHD is impaired executive function. The EFs are the ability to start, sustain, shift, and stop (4S). Numerous studies found the impairment of different domains of EFs in ADHD such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and time perception. Another accepted theory of ADHD is delay aversion theory. Based on this theory, individuals with ADHD are less sensitive to delayed rewards and avoid them. Thus, they prefer an immediate small reward to a big remote one. Also, the value of rewards is reduced across time in healthy individuals, but in individuals with ADHD, the value of rewards has a steeper rate of discounting across the time.  Time perception has been characterized as the ability to predict, anticipate, and respond efficiently to upcoming information. Accordingly, temporal abilities encompass the perception of timing (e.g., time estimation and discrimination), motor timing regarding temporal order of behaviors), and the imagination of timing (such as temporal foresight or inter-temporal bridging).

Different aspects of time perception are impaired in individuals with ADHD such as time production, time reproduction, and motor timing.In particular, time perception could be considered as a domain of EFs . EFs guide, direct, and manage our behavior with a superior point of view. It seems that this supervisory role of EFs not only is related to a spatial domain or point of view but also encompasses a temporal domain. In particular, behavior should be mon- itored not only before execution in the case of planning but also throughout the execution to perform properly. Based on this point of view, we can consider two dimensions for the EFs including *spatial* and *temporal*. The spatial domain, as a static information processing ability, empowers individuals to ride on information and form an abstraction from a dominant point of view. The temporal domain, as a dynamic information processing ability, enables indivi- duals to change their point of view based on their prediction, anticipation, and response to the situations. Based on this classification, all of our goal-directed behaviors that are governed by EFs require the temporal domain. In this classification, time perception is an embedded domain of all EFs which allow them to perform dynamically. The correlational studies between EFs and time perception support this assumption for different domains of EFs such as working memory, inhibitory control, planning, set-shifting, and decision-making. Given the behavioral manifestation of ADHD, time perception could be considered as the cognitive underpinning of some of these syndromes. For instance, impulsivity is correlated with a reduction in tolerance to delays, poor temporal foresight (future blindness), and steeper delay discounting. In the same way, inattentiveness as another main symptom of ADHD could be explained as the consequence of the abnormal time perception. In fact, the impaired sustained attention appears in the light of a long time period, and individuals with ADHD can maintain their attention in a short interval. Moreover,the problem of abnormal arousal and sensitivity to rewards stemmed from abnormal time processing Nejati et al.,. In a nutshell, almost all items of rating questionnaire have a root in the timing disabilities. Given the current state of literature, the quality of time perception deficits in indivi- duals with ADHD remains unclear. In particular, tasks are various in the case of trial timing, modality of stimuli, and procedure of tasks. In what follows, we review the possible effects of these determinants on impaired time perception. First, duration, as the time that should be worked on for each trail and/or all over the task, makes the task different in nature. The longer the time periods, the more mental effort is required to perform the task.

Second is the modality of stimuli. The majority of studies in the field use auditory and/ or visual stimuli. On the one hand, the time processing, as an EF, should be modality independent. On the other hand, the capacity of processor, style of information proces- sing, respective neural pathway, and processing resources vary from modality to mod- <a name="_bookmark21"></a>ality. For instance, the capacity of sensory memory, lasts for several milliseconds, is 20 items for iconic memory and 2–3 items for echoic memory. In addition, the durability of echoic memory is longer than iconic memory (up to 4 s vs. 500 ms).

Additionally, in short-term memory, lasting 2 to 3 min, the capacity for visual items is bigger than phonological items (3–4 vs. 7 ± 2). Although the visual capacity is lower than the phonological one in number, each visual item can carry more features per se. In other words, the parallel visual features, compared to the serial auditory features, are chunked together and make each item more informative. Furthermore, the style of information processing is different based on the nature of modality. Auditory stimuli are processed serially and visual stimuli are processed in parallel (Droit-Volet et al.,. Finally, the cortical correlates of auditory and visual perception are different.

In the case of ADHD, the modality is a more decisive factor in temporal capability. Individuals with ADHD, compared to matched control, have an impaired visuospatial memory(Martinussen et al.,, and their auditory working memory impaired less than visual working memory.

In the time perception context, some studies found that the problem of time processing in individuals with ADHD is limited to visual but not to auditory stimuli. The problem is more prominent if these modalities were presented intermittently. Third is the procedure of tasks. In some tasks, individuals are asked to estimate the elapsed time with a verbal report, and in some other tasks, they had to reproduce the time that is shown with an action such as turning on a light. Accordingly, different cognitive requirements of these tasks have an effective impact on the capability of time perception.

The main goal of the current meta-analysis study is to determine the role of task properties on quality of time perception in individuals with ADHD.

**Methods**
This meta-analysis review was conducted based on the standard guidelines for conduct- ing and reporting systematic review studies, including preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman DG & PRISMA Group, 2009).

***Search strategy***
A systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant studies. First, we searched the electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer, SAG, and Wiley) and the web of knowledge up to June 1, 2019, for studies that target time perception in children with ADHD. The following keywords were used for the search: ADHD OR “attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,” AND “Time Perception” OR Timing OR “Time Deficit” OR “Time Reproduction” OR “Time Estimation” OR “Time Discrimination.” In addition, we identi- fied further papers by reference tracing and consulting review articles. After exclusion of duplicate publications, two authors (S.Y. and V.N.) independently reviewed the retrieved studies consecutively on title, abstract, and full text, using identical selection criteria.

***Eligibility criteria***
Studies that examined time perception in clinical samples of ADHD according to well- established assessment tools are included. The assessment tools for meeting the criteria of ADHD were diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-V or IV)


(American Psychiatric Association), child schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia, present and lifetime version (K-SADS-PL), and Conner’s Rating Scale in both parent and teacher versions. Moreover, the other inclusion criteria were the age of the participant (the age of study population must be less than 18 years old), having neurotypical age-matched and gender- matched control group, using at least one time perception test, having accessible raw data in the paper for calculation of the effect size, and publishing in the English language. The studies that consisted of the ADHD samples with a comorbidity such as learning disorders or psychiatric disorders are excluded.

***Study selection and data extraction***
Relevant data were extracted by both authors independently. After the individualistic search process, each researcher reviewed the published articles and filled in the form of extracting the information separately. For accuracy checking, two appraisers examined each other’s infor- mation, and ultimately, extracted variables are checked by both of them. The extracted data included bibliographic information, age, gender type of time perception tasks (estimation, reproduction, anticipation, tapping, discrimination, and anticipation), stimulus modality (visual, auditory, or both), time intervals (duration in milliseconds to seconds), sample size, age, assessment tools for meeting ADHD, and the findings. Final screening and assessment for eligibility and criteria compliance were agreed upon at a consensus meeting between authors. Finally, 25 out of 74 studies met our criteria and thus were selected as the subjects of meta-analysis. Given the PRISMA worksheet for meta-analysis, the required information from each study was extracted and coded. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mehandi and Midas procedures in statistical software, STATA version 12 ([Figure 1].

***Characteristics of studies***
[Table 1 ] presents the results of 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. All of these studies have used non-probability sampling method in both genders. In these studies, a wide variety of tasks were used for the evaluation of time perception including temporal discrimination, reproduction, anticipation, tapping, and verbal estimation ([Table 1].

***Data synthesis and statistical analysis***
The mean and standard deviation of the task scores, sample size, and properties of tasks extracted from the selected studies were used as our raw data for calculation of effect size. For the effect size, Cohen’s d was calculated as the difference between two means divided by the pooled standard deviation of both groups. In addition, meta-regression analysis is used for the evaluation of the impact of categorical and continuous moderator variables in effect sizes. Given the heterogeneity of the included studies, random-effects models were used with the I-square statistic. The I-square index describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance. I-square could be calculated from basic results obtained from a typical meta-analysis as I<sup>2</sup> = 100% × (Q − df)/Q.

**Figure 1.** The PRISMA chart of study.

In this equation, Q is Cochran’s heterogeneity statistic and df is the degrees of freedom.

Furthermore, the heterogeneity in the meta-analysis related to the variation in the study outcomes was evaluated by the I-square test. The possibility of a publication bias in the present study was examined by visually inspecting funnel plots and applying the regression intercept of Egger et al. In this way, we assessed whether there was a tendency for selective publication of studies based on the nature and direction of their results. In addition, we used the fail-safe procedure to generate the number of unpub- lished studies that would be needed to move estimates to a nonsignificant threshold.

For meta-regression analysis to measure heterogeneity among studies in each mod- erator, the variable statistic was evaluated with the I-square index. Significant hetero- geneity was detected for the pooled estimate. At this point, the sensitivity analysis was also performed, and the findings showed that no study had skewed the overall result. Since significant heterogeneity was found across studies, the second-step univariate analyses were conducted to test the individual association of each variable (age, task, modality, and time interval) with the overall effect size of time perception using random meta-regression analyses. This analytical strategy evaluated which variables affected the results. Notably, the performance of each time interval in each task was used as a variable of our analysis. In such a case, the problem of small numbers of studies which used a unique task was solved.

**Results**
As illustrated in [Table 2], the average of the combined effect sizes of time perception in children and adolescents aged from 6 to 18 years was 0.179 in the random-effects model, which is significant (*z* = 3.03, *p* < .001).

In detail, the tasks that are used in the reviewed studies were estimation (8 studies), reproduction (15 studies), anticipation (5 studies), tapping (3 studies), and discrimination (4 studies). Notably, some studies use two or more tasks for assessment of time perception (12 studies). Considering the type of task as a moderator in the meta-regression analysis showed no significant effect for the type of task in the performance. In the case of task modality, nine studies used auditory stimuli, nine studies used visual stimuli, and seven studies used both visual and auditory stimuli. Similarly, given the modality as a moderator, we found no significant effect for different modalities. The time interval varies from 32 ms to 14 min; all times were converted into seconds for analysis. Considering the time interval as a moderator found that the longer the time, the higher the effect size of the study.

Furthermore, the combined effect sizes of all studies were significant. The impact of moderator variables on time perception effect size was evaluated as random meta- regression that includes the type of temporal tasks (discrimination, reproduction, antici- pation, tapping, and verbal estimation), durations/interval, modalities, and the mean age of two groups. The β is presented for each covariate separately in [Table 3].

[Table 3 ]shows a meta-regression analysis to estimate between-study variation due to heterogeneity. The proportion of between-study variance explained the joint test for all covariates with Knapp–Hartung modification. In this table, the effects of all four above- mentioned moderator variables on effect size are described separately. In the meta- regression of the zero hypothesis, according to [Table 3], the coefficient of moderator variable mean was zero and does not have any relation to the effect size.

Meta-regression analyses revealed no significant effects on the findings for the age in ADHD group (β = 0.023, CI = −0.067 to.114, *t* = 0.51, *p* = .611) and no significant effects on the findings for the age in control group (β = 0.120, CI = −0.077 to 0.101, *t* = 0.27, *p* = .791). The type of task, as moderator variable, was categorical. For such a multi-state variable, the most frequent variable is considered as the control group. The reproduction task in this study has the highest frequency (79%). Meta-regression analyses revealed no significant effect on the findings for none of the tasks. The values for each task were calculated as follows: reproduction task (β = 0.101, CI = −0.102 to 0.305, *t* = 0.98, *p* = .327), estimation task (β = −0.12, CI = −0.512 to 0.270, *t* = −0.61, *p* = .541), anticipation task (β = −0.416, CI = −1.586 to 0\.753, *t* = −0.70, *p* = .482), tapping task (β = 0.038, CI = −61.046 to 61.123, *t* = 0.01, *p* = .999), and discrimination task (β = −0.027, CI = – 0.953 to 0.898, *t* = −0.06, *p* = .953).

The modality moderator variable is also considered in three categories, and here, the visual modality has the highest frequency and is considered as the control variable. Meta- regression analyses revealed no significant effect for visual modality (β = 0.001, CI = −0.195 to 0.197, *t* = 0.01, *p* = .991), auditory modality (β = 0.264, CI = −0.435to 0.964, *t* = 0.75, *p* = .456), and combined visual/auditory modalities (β = 0.204, CI = −0.212 to 0.620, *t* = 0.97, *p* = .991).

Meta-regression analyses revealed a significant effect for time interval variable in the used temporal tests (β = −0.006, CI = −0.012 to −0.000, *t* = −2.06, *p* = .041). Accordingly, the longer the time interval, the larger the effect size.

***Publication bias***
Visual inspection of funnel plots revealed no evidence for publication bias. Quantitative evaluation of publication bias, measured by the Egger intercept, indicated a nonsignificant effect (*p* = .14). The fail-safe procedure estimated that 522 unpublished studies would be needed to bring the overall meta-analytic estimate to nonsignificance. The heterogeneity in the published studies was large and statistically significant (I-square = 92.8%, *p* = .001, Tau- squared = 0.3912, heterogeneity chi-squared = 1530.56, df = 135, *p* = .001). The hetero- geneity of each moderator variables was large and statistically significant (I-squared for age in ADHD group = 97.05%, age of control group = 97.04%, task = 97.66%, modal- ity = 97.62%, and time interval = 97.30%). Funnel plot pseudo with 95% confidence limits revealed no evidence of publication bias ([Figure 2].

**Discussion**
The results of our meta-analysis found a significant impairment in time estimation, reproduction, discrimination, anticipation, and tapping in children with ADHD in at least one domain and one time interval. The impaired time perception in children with ADHD could be explained in different levels from behavior to neurotransmitter.

In the behavioral and cognitive levels, as mentioned earlier, time perception is a dynamic component of EFs, and the majority of ADHD symptoms could be explained by time perception .

In the neural level, time perception engages several brain areas including the anterior cingulate, prefrontal and parietal cortices, and basal ganglia which are all involved in individuals with ADHD. 
In the neurotransmitter level, the level of dopamine tunes the activity of internal clock so a decrease in the dopaminergic activity leads to deceleration of clock speed (the underestimation of the elapsed time) and an increase in dopaminergic level leads to acceleration of internal clock speed. The importance of frontostriatal circuitry in time perception is in line with this dopamine-related internal clock theory. Further, dopamine-related theory of <a name="_bookmark40"></a>ADHD states that individuals with ADHD have an impairment in dopamine transfer, and this factor alters their sensitivity to rewards and time perception. However, in line with this theory, all the deficits of time perception in individuals with ADHD should appear as overestimation which is not confirmed by our findings.

Given the general agreement of reviewed studies about the impaired time perception in children with ADHD, in what follows, we tried to explain the role of task criteria in this finding. In this case, the nature of tasks including the cognitive demand, modality, and duration in different studies has been considered as a subgroup of our meta-analysis.

***Duration***
The duration of task trials, the results of this study found that the longer the duration, the larger the effect size. In particular, children with ADHD have an intact time perception in a short time interval. For instance, some studies found intact time perception in duration less than 4 ms, 3 s, 1200 ms, 5 s, 550 ms, 2 s, and 1 s.

Longer time window duration has fuelled a heated debate in the respective literature. On the one hand, some researchers have found an intact time perception in individuals with ADHD for all time windows. On the other hand, the other researchers have reported an abnormal time perception in individuals with ADHD for all time windows. Importantly, the impairment in time perception in children with ADHD could be discussed in the light of time window duration. For instance, the impairment was found in duration longer than 48 s or even longer than 4 s.

It is worth mentioning that the neural underpinnings of short and long durations are not the same. This differentiation has been shown for the time intervals below and above 500 ms. Furthermore, the processing correlates of these two are different in the way that the intervals below 500 ms are processed upon implicit mechanisms, while processing of intervals above 500 ms involves cognitive control. With respect to the impaired cognitive control in individuals with ADHD, the problem of time perception in longer intervals could be explored.

Given the time perception as a dynamic component of EFs, stated earlier, it is worth mentioning that the longer the task period, the higher the cognitive effort. In line with this view, the time interval can determine the cognitive demand of tasks. Accordingly, it has found that the temporal tasks which last around several seconds are handled by working memory, but the tasks longer than 20–30 s are engaged long-term memory.

Furthermore, the impaired sustained attention, as the main cognitive correlate of ADHD symptoms, revealed in long time durations. Thus, their performance in short time task remained normal and near normal.

With respect to the delay discounting slope, individuals with ADHD have a steeper delay gradient when contemplating hypothetical later rewards. In other words, the amount of value declines faster through the time.

Notably, the duration of task influences the direction of abnormal estimation in the way that children with ADHD underestimate shorter period and overestimate the longer one. However, some studies state that abnormal time estimation in children with ADHD appears as overestimation for short duration (0.5 and 2 s) and underestimation for long duration (3, 4, and 6 s). It is worth mentioning that the amount of over-/underestimation with respect to the total time window should be taken into account. Further study should consider this matter and report and analyze the over-/underestimation as percentage.

At the neural level, the differentiation of long duration and short duration in time perception could be followed with neural correlate. A neuroimaging study found the differ- ence between neural correlates of short and long time duration. Some brain areas are involved in both short and long duration such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex/insula, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and/or right intraparietal sulcus. These areas handle some general components of temporal processing such as attention allocation, encoding, and retrieval of information. When the duration of the task increases, the mesiofrontal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex, and right caudate nucleus are involved in time perception.

Collectively, the best time for the evaluation of time perception problems in children with ADHD is the time periods longer than 5 s.

***Modality***
The reviewed studies found a similar pattern of time perception deficit in both auditory and visual stimuli. In line with our study, another meta-analysis in depression found no significant differences between the two modalities in time perception tasks. Time is primarily encoded in the auditory cortex for both visual and auditory stimuli, in the way that temporary inhibition of the auditory cortex by transcranial magnetic stimulation leads to time estimation impairment in both auditory and visual modalities. Then, we can conclude that the perception of time is beyond modality. This modality-independent role of the primary auditory area in time percep- tion has been found using transcranial electrical stimulation as well. 

However, there are some differences between temporal processing of visual and auditory modalities in the way that the visual interval takes a longer time period to perceive. Furthermore, individuals have higher sensitivity and lower variability when they are exposed to auditory time interval that may be related to auditory coding of temporal information. Serial coding of auditory stimuli, compared to the parallel coding of visual stimuli, prepares a precise processing.

***Task procedure***
Some properties of task procedure should be taken into account as influential task demands including the temporal orientation and notion of task.

The temporal orientation of task refers to the perception of elapsed, current, or coming time period. With respect to these properties, the time perception tasks are prospective or retrospective. The cognitive demands of these two are different; prospective tasks stemmed in attention and other EFs and retrospective tasks rely on memory. In the reviewed articles, only Mc Gee (2004) used both retrospective and prospective tasks in which a higher effect size is shown in prospective task that is matched with the nature of the task that relies on attention more than memory. In the retrospective task, individuals should memorize the duration of time that can be considered as a passive information holding, but in the prospective task, the active and online information processing is required.

Another factor in task procedure is the type of task. There were five task types in our reviewed studies including time discrimination, estimation, reproduction, imagination, and motor timing. The type of task has not any significant effect on the time perception capability in both children with and without ADHD.

***The subtype of ADHD***
The included study did not find any subtype-specific differences in the impairment of time perception. This finding is in line with the study that found no correlation between the symptom scale hyperactivity/impulsivity and performance of time perception tasks.

Furthermore, time perception has a twofold nature that affects different subtypes of ADHD. On the one hand, hyperactive and impulsive symptoms occur because of a delay aversion and lack of future sight which is a property of time perception. On the other hand, the inattentiveness as another symptom originates from lack of sustained effort over time. Thus, in individuals with ADHD, forgetting and impairment in planning are rooted in impaired prospective memory as a part of abnormal prospective time percep- tion per se.

Some limitations should be taken into account in the present meta-analysis. One limitation of our study was the different methods which are used for diagnosis. For example, use of DSM-IV or V that have some differences in the criteria of ADHD leads to inconsistency in group assignment in different studies. Another limitation is the variety of tasks that make it difficult to have a unique procedure for all studies.
