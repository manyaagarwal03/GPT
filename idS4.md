Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) – and its underlying behavioral dimensions of inattention and hyperactivity–impulsivity – have been understudied in females. We first cover the conceptual issues of prevalence, diagnostic practices, diversity, comorbidity, and causal factors, plus forces limiting awareness of ADHD in females. After a narrative review of cross-sectional and longitudinal findings, we conclude the following. (a) Girls meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD at just under half the rates of boys, a ratio that becomes much closer to equal by adulthood. (b) Girls and women with ADHD show a predominance of inattention and associated internalizing problems; boys and men display greater levels of hyperactive–impulsive symptoms and associated externalizing problems. (c) Sex differences in ADHD symptoms and related outcomes depend heavily on the clinical versus nonreferred nature of the samples under investigation. (d) Females with ADHD experience, on average, serious impairments, with a particularly heightened risk for problems in close relationships and engagement in self-harm. (e) Clinicians may overlook symptoms and impairments in females because of less overt (but still impairing) symptom manifestations in girls and women and their frequent adoption of compensatory strategies. Our review of predictors and mediators of adult outcomes highlights (a) the potential for heterotypically continuous pathways in females with childhood ADHD and (b) developmental progressions to self-harm, intimate partner violence, unplanned pregnancy, and comorbid psychopathology. Focusing on ADHD in females is necessary to characterize causal and maintaining mechanisms with accuracy and to foster responsive interventions, as highlighted in our closing list of clinical implications and research priorities. 

Keywords: ADHD; developmental psychopathology; self-harm; girls and women.


**Introduction**

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves developmentally extreme and cross- situational  manifestations  of  (a)  inattention  and/or (b) hyperactivity–impulsivity. Considerable research reveals substantial impairments in key domains of functioning throughout the life span for individuals either surpassing or falling just below diagnostic thresholds (Hinshaw, 2018). Given space limita- tions, we direct readers to the masterful review of developmental origins of ADHD in Nigg, Sibley, Thapar, and Karalunas (2020) and the provocative overview of biological correlates of ADHD during adolescent development in Shaw and Sudre (2021). Until recently, however, almost all research in this area has focused on boys and men. Female presen- tations have been largely overlooked in both clinical and research settings . To redress this historical neglect, we provide current evidence on both (a) sex differences with respect to ADHD across the life span, and (b) female-specific impair- ments, mechanisms, and developmental pathways. Male-dominated  samples  have long  characterized a great many behavioral science and biomedical endeavors. Three decades ago, calls emerged for equitable representation of females in science and medicine (see U.S. guidelines [National Institutes of Health, 1994], which have received periodic updates; see also updated U.K. guidelines [Great Britain Home Office, 2018]). Eating disorders and depres- sion, which both display female overrepresentation, are exceptions to this widespread trend. Yet even when mixed-sex samples are available, many scien- tists fail to examine sex-related differences or mod- erator effects. Merit also exists in considering conditions like ADHD in an all-female context. Despite growing commitment to diversify research samples, a lack of substantial progress toward full female representation remains . A similar critique can be made regarding the lack of research on, for example, males with eating disorders or depression. A core objective of gender-representative samples is generalizability, a point that also pertains to socioe- conomic and racial  diversity.  Empirically  question- ing the assumption of universal etiologies, developmental pathways, and/or therapeutic pro- cesses across males and females should result in better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Similarly, comprehending sex differences in and female presentations of ADHD should enhance both scientific accuracy and clinical prowess.

As discussed below, the prevalence of  ADHD  in boys is 2–2.5 times higher than  its  prevalence  in girls. A male predominance is the case for most if not all neurodevelopmental disorders . We therefore open with three concep- tual issues about sex differences. First, theories exist regarding the nature of psychopathology with lower prevalence in either sex. According to the ‘gender paradox’, the sex with lower preva- lence is expected to display more severe features as well as higher rates of comorbid disorders. Two explanatory models are relevant. (a) The *polygenetic multiple threshold* model holds that the lower- prevalence sex (e.g., females with ADHD) would need to have greater levels of family history and a higher genetic ‘load’ and/or environmental disadvantage to meet diagnostic criteria. (b) In the *constitutional variability* model, boys are slower to mature than girls, leading to a greater propensity for exhibiting a wide spectrum of neu- rodevelopmental symptoms. Given the extreme gen- der atypicality of her symptoms in relation to other females, a girl with significant ADHD would thus be likely to have demonstrable neural dysfunction.

Second, even in representative samples, the sex ratio of diagnosed ADHD approaches 1.5:1 or lower during the adult years. For one thing,  girls  are  more  likely than boys to display inattention as the predominant symptom domain , and inattentive symptoms are more likely to persist through     adulthood. Thus, females appear prone to display a more ‘life- persistent’ form of ADHD. As well, symptom lists for ADHD are biased toward male behaviors (e.g., phys- ical overactivity or  extreme  risk-taking) as  opposed to female-related manifestations (e.g., excessive ver- balizations or more subtle indicators of impulsivity). Furthermore, females are less likely than males to display disruptive behaviors (or at least have a later onset of such), curtailing early detection. Finally, children are rated for ADHD via parent and teacher reports, but adult assessment is typically based on self-report – with women more likely to disclose relevant problems. 

Third, as reviewed by Asherson and Agnew-Blais (2019), over the last decade several birth-cohort studies challenged the assumption that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder inevitably beginning in childhood. Strikingly, adult-onset individuals in these investigations comprised half or more women. Yet (a) many such cases have heightened but sub- threshold ADHD symptoms in childhood, (b) comor- bidities explain a substantial proportion of so-called adult-emergent cases, and (c) far more  evidence exists for adolescent or very-early adult onset  of ADHD than in later adulthood. Regardless, ADHD is increasingly salient for females by the adult years.

We provide a final note on terminology, as to whether discussion should focus on *gender* versus *sex* differences . Following conven- tion, we use *sex* to denote biological male or female status (acknowledging that this designation is not a binary) and *gender* to depict the social and/or cultural roles applied to biological sex or the per- sonal identification with such roles.


**ADHD and psychopathology: background issues**

The topic of ADHD is the subject of a voluminous and still-growing literature. Issues regarding this diag- nosis are often controversial in both science and the public eye (Hinshaw, 2018). We contend that a developmental psychopathology perspective is essential (Hinshaw, 2017). Rather than viewing ADHD as a static diagnostic entity, a focus on its dimensional components is often fruitful (see the Research Domain Criteria [RDoC]; Cuthbert & Insel, 2013). Furthermore, incorporating concepts such as transactional models of development, multiple levels of analysis, heterotypic continuity, and the conflu- ence of heritable and psychosocial underpinnings of symptom domains will continue to be illuminating.

**Prevalence, including race/ethnicity**

Given the lack of validated biomarkers for any mental health or neurodevelopmental syndrome, it is impossible to gauge the actual prevalence of conditions  like ADHD. Diagnosed prevalence rates of ADHD in the United States have been rising steadily over the past several decades in both boys and girls. According to population surveys, 9.4% of all children and adoles- cents aged 2–17 years have received an ADHD diagnosis, as reported by parents, with a male: female sex ratio of 2.3:1. Such estimates are above those of nearly every other country on earth with relevant data, especially when rarely diagnosed 2- to 3-year-olds are excluded. We note, however, that regional differences are evident in the United States and other countries. One potential explanation has to do with school- testing policies known as c*onsequential accountabil- ity* statutes (Fulton, Scheffler, & Hinshaw, 2015). An unintended consequence is that rates of ADHD diagnosis rise precipitously for a state’s most impov- erished children when such ‘test scores at all costs’ policies are enacted. In addition, Caye et al. (2020) review the effect of ‘relative age’ – that is, being young for one’s grade level – on the propensity for ADHD diagnosis. In both instances, sex differences are unclear.

Regarding adult ADHD, prevalence estimates are confounded by the developmental reality that phys- ical activity and behavioral impulsivity decline from childhood through adulthood. After the teen years, it becomes difficult to ascertain when symptom levels are indicative of remission. Accordingly, estimates of the percentage of children who maintain the diagnosis into adult- hood range widely, from under one-third to a sub- stantial majority. Still, a growing consensus is that well over half of diagnosed children display impair- ing adult symptoms even when strict diagnostic criteria are no longer met.

The racial composition of who gets diagnosed with ADHD has shifted substantially of late, at least in the United States. Although diagnosis was reserved largely for White, middle-class boys during the 20th  century,  Ce´nat  et  al.  (2021)  documented  that Black youth have now surpassed White youth  in terms of diagnosed prevalence, in both sexes  (see also Danielson et al., 2018). Furthermore, although Latinx youth have traditionally had lower diagnostic rates than other ethnic groups, the gap is closing (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014). Greater awareness among professionals is relevant, but  it  is  possible that ADHD may become – or has recently become – a convenient diagnostic label for youth experiencing impoverishment and/or trauma.

**Diagnostic practices**

Related to this last point, we comment briefly on the kinds of assessment practices typically used to diagnose ADHD in clinical as opposed to research settings. Despite evidence-based guidelines pre- pared by the American Academy of Child and Ado- lescent Psychiatry (Pliszka & AACAP Work Group on Quality Issues, 2007) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (Wolraich et al., 2019) in the United States, and the National  Institute  for  Health  and Care Excellence (2019) in the U.K., general pediatri- cians and adult practitioners are often not suffi- ciently trained in (or reimbursed for, in the United States) such evidence-based assessments. A 15 minute office visit without normed informant rating scales, developmental histories, medical examina- tions, or testing to consider comorbid psychiatric and learning conditions may lead to both overdiag- nosis and underdiagnosis, with the former more likely for boys but the latter for girls (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014). Major dividends should accrue from adequate resources for accurate assessments, including the recognition that ADHD clearly exists in girls and women. In addition, inattentive symptoms should be accounted for across the life span, espe- cially during transitions from elementary to sec- ondary school, which present new challenges with less adult scaffolding, and to pregnancy and parent- hood, including hormonal changes that may exacer- bate symptoms . Finally, mood and anxiety symptoms frequently accompany female ADHD, mandating careful differential and/or addi- tional diagnosis, particularly given the high risk for self-harm in females with ADHD.

**Clinical vs. representative samples**

Biases accrue from making generalizations about causal mechanisms, symptom profiles, or treatment responses in clinically referred versus nonreferred/ population-based samples (Goodman et al., 1997; LeWinn, Sheridan, Keyes, Hamilton, & McLaughlin, 2017). As highlighted below, conclusions about sex differences in levels of ADHD-related symptoms and/or impairments can differ dramatically depend- ing on referral source.

**Comorbidity and associated psychopathology**

Individuals with any given mental condition are highly likely to experience additional syndromes. By definition, such *comorbidity* comprises the joint presence of two or more independent manifes- tations of psychopathology. Yet the extraordinarily high rates of comorbidity – far above levels pre- dictable if the underlying conditions were truly independent – lend strong suspicion to the idea that other mechanisms are at play. Supposedly indepen- dent disorders may be linked in terms of risk factors and even symptoms. Moreover, a general liability to all forms of mental disorder is increasingly investi- gated, with respect to the so-called general psy- chopathology (or ‘p’) factor. Finally, what appears to be  the sequential  presence of different categorical diagnoses – for example, from early ADHD to later conduct disorder, followed by substance use disorders and adult antisocial per- sonality disorder for males and self-harmful behav- iors and adult borderline personality disorder for females– may actually reflect heterotypic continuity. This concept denotes the stability of an underlying   predisposition   that   yields   changing symptoms across development as the result of a range of biological and contextual forces.

**Heritable and psychosocial influences**
Genetically informative investigations reveal that ADHD, appraised dimensionally or categorically, is strongly heritable (for an informative review of potential genetic and endocrine mechanisms potentially underlying sex differences, see Davies, 2014). Yet high heritability does not imply that symptom presentation and/or impairment are devoid of environmental input. Indeed, extreme environmental deprivation may engender inattention and overactivity (usually linked with highly aberrant attachment). In more typical cases, negative parent–child interactions often maintain and exacerbate heritable tendencies toward impul- sivity and dysregulation , even in adoptive families . For girls with ADHD, parenting stress related to caring for such a daughter can magnify the under- lying tendencies and predict subsequent impairment in adolescence and beyond.

Nonheritable biological risk factors – such as prenatal maternal alcohol or nicotine use, low birthweight, or  exposure  to  toxic  substances  early in life – are implicated in some cases of  ADHD. Genetic vulnerability may well statistically interact with environmental triggers in the genesis of signif- icant symptoms; inflammatory processes may also play a role . All too little research exists on sex differences in the unfolding of such transactional processes (see Martin et al., 2018, for findings related to common- versus rare-variant genotypes in males versus females). Important intraindividual mechanisms linked to ADHD – dys- regulated attention, poor executive functions (e.g., working memory, response inhibition), low intrinsic motivation, and emotion dysregulation (for at least a subgroup) – are well established (Sonuga-Barke & Halperin, 2010). Still, most of the relevant research emanates from predominantly or exclusively male samples.

Loyer Carbonneau, Demers, Bigras, and Guay (2020) provided a comprehensive meta-analysis of symptoms and underlying mechanisms related to sex differences in youth with ADHD. In short, objective indicators revealed that boys show greater hyperactivity than girls but statistically equivalent levels of inattention. Yet teachers rate boys as higher on both, with the clear implication that adult ratings may lead to underreporting and underdiagnosis of ADHD in girls (see Abikoff, Courtney, Pelham, & Koplewicz, 1993, regarding halo effects in adult informant ratings). Regarding executive functions, girls with ADHD have, on average, greater cognitive flexibility, and better motor response inhibition than boys, although the sexes are similar with respect to interference control and working memory (Loyer Carbonneau et al., 2020). Overall, it is essential to examine sex differences in, and female-specific manifestations of, both symptoms/impairments and mechanistic processes.


Girls with ADHD: what do we know? Pioneering work in the systematic investigation of females with ADHD began four decades ago (e.g., Ackerman, Sykman, & Oglesby, 1983; Kashani, Chapel, Ellis, & Shekim, 1979; for other early empirical studies, see Berry, Shaywitz, & Shaywitz, 1985; Biederman et al., 1994; James & Taylor, 1990; Mannuzza & Gittelman, 1984; McGee & Feehan, 1991). Because many mixed-sex samples had extre- mely small female subsamples (e.g., Barkley, Fis- cher, Smallish, & Fletcher, 2002), calls for focus on girls and women with ADHD have continued (Bark- ley, 2002; Nussbaum, 2012; Quinn &  Madhoo, 2014; Staller & Faraone, 2006).

Key reasons for the longstanding underrepresen- tation of females with ADHD include the following:

(a) long-term scientific/professional insistence that the condition was vanishingly rare in girls (and even more so in women, as ADHD was assumed to be childhood-limited); 

(b) predominance of the inatten- tive (and less visibly impairing) presentation in females 

(c) lower rates of co-occurring disruptive behavior disorders in girls or later onset of such, suppressing the visibility and salience of female symptoms; (d) clinician bias that ADHD symptoms are indicative of the diagnosis in boys but not girls;  (e)  the finding that parent and teacher ratings systemati- cally underreport female, as opposed to male, ADHD behavior patterns, even when objectively observed behaviors are matched between the sexes; and (f) higher rates of compensatory behaviors in females. We selectively review findings in childhood through mid-adolescence.

In an intriguing early study, James and Taylor (1990) extracted a small sample of 61 boys and 18 girls with diagnosed hyperkinetic disorder – a diagnosis far more stringent than the current ADHD criteria – from a large clinical sample. The female subsample was overrepresented with language dis- orders and low IQ scores compared with the male subsample. Such a pattern is just what would be predicted from the constitutional variability model.


Yet clinical samples are, by definition, not repre- sentative of the population. The importance of sampling issues cannot be over- stated: The important, early meta-analytic reviews of sex differences in ADHD  gave ample evidence that the type of sample investigated (clinical versus nonre- ferred/community) had considerable effect on con- clusions. Gaub and Carlson (1997) found that, overall, boys display greater symptom severity and externalizing comorbidity levels than girls, whereas the latter reveal greater cognitive impairments. Yet both referral source and informant (e.g., parent vs. teacher) were crucial moderators, as opposite pat- terns of findings for the two types of samples and raters sometimes emerged. Additional clinical sam- ples yield contradictory outcomes regarding whether girls with ADHD have equivalent social impairment as boys or greater social/ academic deficits (Rucklidge & Tannock, 2001; see also Elkins, Malone, Keyes, Iacono, & McGue, 2011). If girls with ADHD actually have fewer/less severe symptoms than boys, a core tenet of the gender paradox would be violated, obviating the need for polygenetic multiple threshold versus constitutional variability explanations.

A major step forward occurred via the Mas- sachusetts General Hospital (MGH) studies of boys and girls with ADHD were recruited from psychiatric and pediatric refer- ral sources and followed over time. Note that the sample was predominantly White and initially diagnosed using DSM-III-R criteria, but important methodological advantages (e.g., blinded assess- ments, ascertainment of familiality, measures of educational and cognitive functioning beyond symptoms/diagnoses per se) yielded crucial find- ings. Indeed, in this unprecedentedly large sample of carefully diagnosed girls with ADHD (*n* = 140), comorbidities and impairments were clearly evi- dent, belying the view that ADHD was nonexistent or of trivial importance for females. In fact, func- tional impairment levels matched those of their male ADHD sample, as did rates of comorbid disorders (although girls showed later onset of disruptive behavior problems; Biederman et al., 1994). Most female impairments were evident when covarying comorbid conditions, signaling that ADHD itself predicted impairment.

An equal-sized sample of ethnically and socioeco- nomically diverse girls with ADHD aged 6–12 years at baseline – plus 88 age- and ethnicity-matched comparison girls – was described in Hinshaw (2002) and Hinshaw, Carte, Sami, Treuting, and Zupan (2002). Participants were carefully diagnosed with ADHD using DSM-IV criteria and took part in a 5- week naturalistic research summer program, afford- ing behavioral observations and peer sociometric nominations in addition to adult informant reports and individualized testing data (the investigation is termed the Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study, or BGALS). In relation to the comparison group, the ADHD participants were impaired in all domains of measured functioning (e.g., symptoms, associated psychopathology, family stress, peer rela- tionships, academics, neuropsychological measures, use of special services, self-perceptions), with effect sizes ranging from medium to extremely large. Find- ings held with stringent covariation of demographic and cognitive factors and, in most cases, comorbidi- ties. In the first systematic contrast of Inattentive versus Combined presentations in girls, both sub- groups were highly impaired in relation to the comparison participants but differed significantly from each other only for externalizing behaviors and peer rejection, with the Combined subgroup scoring higher for each. Five-year prospective follow-up into middle adolescence (Hinshaw, Carte, Fan, Jassy, & Owens, 2007; Hinshaw, Owens, Sami, & Fargeon, 2006) revealed enduring impairment in all domains examined. Additionally, the proportion of the ADHD sample meeting criteria for overall positive adjust- ment was distressingly low (Owens, Hinshaw, Lee, & Lahey, 2009). Selected additional findings from BGALS data are reviewed in Owens et al. (2017).

In a large community survey of girls meeting criteria for hyperactivity, conduct problems, or both, followed from childhood to mid-adolescence, Young, Heptinstall, Sonuga-Barke, Chadwick, and Taylor (2005) found that hyperactivity was particularly predictive of pervasive adolescent academic and interpersonal problems. Lahey et al. (2007) found that ADHD in preschool predicted subsequent early- adolescent comorbidities in both sexes, with predic- tions to internalizing comorbidities especially strong for girls.

Overall: First, sex ratios reveal a male predomi- nance of over 2:1 for ADHD in childhood and adolescence. Second, subtle yet important differences in symptoms exist, with respect, for example, to greater verbal overactivity in females versus physical overactivity in males . Also, many girls with ADHD, particularly those with predominant inattention, may compensate with intensive effort and coping strategies (including family coping), masking key impairments and lowering the chance for recogni- tion. Third, comorbidity (regarding categorical diagnoses) and associated features (regarding dimensional vari- ables) differ, as males reveal stronger linkages with externalizing problems (at least in childhood) and females with internalizing problems and possibly language disorders and neurological problems (e.g., Tung et al., 2016). Fourth, ADHD is highly impair- ing in girls during childhood and adolescence regarding major domains of life functioning.


**Developmental progressions, mediators, and heterotypic continuity by adulthood**
The core questions here pertain to outcomes encoun- tered by girls with ADHD by adulthood, along with childhood predictor variables and adolescent medi- ator processes that may presage long-term impair- ments. We also summarize selected cross-sectional investigations of women with ADHD. Some studies of quite-small female subsamples have yielded provocative   exploratory   findings   (e.g.,   Barkley et al., 2002; Sarver, McCart, Sheidow, & Letourneau, 2014). Additionally, Babinski et al. (2010) followed 34 young women with childhood-diagnosed ADHD and 24 without, to the end of adolescence. ADHD- related impairments emerged for some domains (e.g., conflict with parents, depression, fewer romantic relationships) but not for others (e.g., job perfor- mance, substance use).

In the MGH sample, follow-up revealed continuing symptoms and impairments in girls with carefully diagnosed baseline ADHD. Although half or fewer  of such participants  met full diagnostic crite- ria by early adulthood, over two-thirds revealed above-normative symptom levels plus clear func- tional impairments. As for comorbid disorders, Biederman et al. (2010) demon- strated that rates of antisocial, mood, anxiety, developmental, addictive, and eating disorders were substantially elevated beyond those of the compar- ison participants. Furthermore, compared with the MGH males who also were followed  longitudinally, the female sample showed lower rates of adult antisocial behaviors but higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders. Executive functioning perfor- mance was also compromised (Seidman et al., 2006). These findings withstood stringent statistical adjustment for potentially confounding variables. 

In the BGALS follow-ups through an average age of 20 and then 26 years– for which participant retention rates ranged from 93% to 95% – the focus was on functional impairments. Findings   revealed   large and statistically significant  impairment  relative  to the comparison sample, even with stringent statisti- cal adjustment for demographic and cognitive fac- tors. Noteworthy were academic underperformance (especially in mathematics), internalizing disorders, poor executive functions, employment-related problems, unplanned preg- nancy rates (43%  in  the  ADHD  sample  versus  11% of comparisons), high risk for intimate partner violence (Guendelman, Ahmad, Ahmad, Meza, Owens,  &  Hinshaw,  2016),  and  early  engagement in oral sex (Halkett & Hinshaw, 2021). Yet evidence for beyond-normative substance use problems (ex- cept nicotine), driving problems, and eating  prob- lems was not found. Other investigations corroborate serious impair- ment. In a relatively early longitudinal study, Dals- gaard, Mortensen, Frydenberg, and Thomsen (2002) discovered that girls with ADHD (especially those with comorbid conduct problems) had significantly higher risk than parallel boys for subsequent adult inpatient psychiatric admissions. In a large Norwe- gian investigation of women and men with ADHD in adulthood, Fredriksen et al. (2014) found larger incidence of lifetime work-related disability in the female subsample; inattentive symptoms were espe- cially predictive of such difficulties. Furthermore, marked risk for teen motherhood – 15% for females with ADHD versus 3% for comparisons – was revealed in the Swedish cohort study of Skoglund et al. (2019), who also found elevated prenatal and perinatal complications related to those births.

Given its rising rates (especially in females) and clear public-health importance, we focus on self-harm, including nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior. Population studies have revealed a sizable risk for such behaviors among individuals with ADHD (Chen et al., 2014; Hurtig, Taanila, Moilanen, Nord- stro€m, & Ebeling, 2012; see review in Garas & Bala´zs, 2020). As for longitudinal findings, Chronis-Tuscano et al. (2010) found that, among preschoolers with ADHD reassessed in early to late adolescence, rates of depression and suicide attempts were elevated in relation to comparison youth, despite stringent use of covariates. Crucially, these rates were significantly higher in the female compared with male subsample. In more recent research, women with ADHD had particularly high rates of NSSI,   suicidal   ideation, and suicidal behavior, even as compared with their male coun- terparts.

For the initial BGALS indication of increased risk for self-harm, Hinshaw et al. (2012). reported that, by early adulthood, girls with childhood ADHD- Combined (but not Inattentive) presentation had markedly higher rates of attempted suicide  (22% for ADHD-C, 8% for ADHD-I, and 6% for compar- isons) and moderate-to-severe NSSI (51%, 29%, and 19%, respectively), even with stringent use of key covariates (see also Owens et al., 2017). A series of theoretically driven mediator analyses followed. (a) Swanson, Owens, and Hinshaw (2014) found that early-to-mid-adolescent *internalizing* behaviors (as reported by parents, teachers, and participants) significantly and partially mediated the link between childhood ADHD and subsequent suicide attempts, but adolescent *externalizing* behaviors (parent- and teacher-reported) and an objective indicator of poor executive  functioning  were  parallel  mediators  of NSSI. (b) Regarding peer relationships, Meza, Owens, and Hinshaw (2016) reported that teacher- reported *peer rejection* in adolescence significantly and partially mediated the link to subsequent sui- cide attempts, whereas self-reported *peer victimiza- tion* mediated the link to NSSI. (c) As for maltreatment, Guendelman, Owens, Owens, Galan, Gard, and Hinshaw (2016) utilized multi-informant, blinded ratings of each BGALS participant for evi- dence of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and/or neglect in childhood through early adolescence. For one thing, ADHD participants showed greater inci- dence of maltreatment than the comparisons. Next, and crucially, among ADHD participants the experi- ence of one or more forms of such maltreatment predicted both depression and elevated risk for suicide attempts by early adulthood. In fact, the rate of such attempts was over 33% for participants with childhood ADHD who had also experienced one or more forms of maltreatment. In short, the combina- tion of maltreatment and highly heritable ADHD symptoms was linked to an extraordinarily high risk for suicidal behavior – paralleling work on bipolar disorder, also highly heritable, for which maltreat- ment predicts heightened risk of suicidality. In short, reduc- tionistic accounts of relevant risk as either exclu- sively heritable or exclusively contextual are not accurate.

Meza, Owens, and Hinshaw (2020) examined childhood predictors of NSSI, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts in BGALS participants followed through their mid-20s. Key predictors of NSSI were childhood ADHD symptoms, externalizing behaviors, poor executive functioning, and participant percep- tions of *paternal* (but not maternal) negative parent- ing. The significant childhood predictors of suicidal ideation were low perceived self-competence and a history of adverse child experiences; for attempted suicide, the significant predictors were elevated- childhood ADHD symptoms (both inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity), adverse childhood expe- riences, and low perceived self-competence. Interac- tions between predictor variables emerged, indicating moderation effects. For example, regard- ing lifetime NSSI, 80% of participants with this form of self-injury had childhood externalizing *and* inter- nalizing scores in the clinical range *plus* poor child- hood executive functioning.

In short, for substantial numbers of  girls  with ADHD, a heterotypically continuous trajectory from early impulsivity (and in some cases, high levels of concurrent early inattention) is salient. Associated psychopathology (internalizing and/or externaliz- ing), executive dysfunction, maltreatment or other early adverse experiences, negative father–daughter interactions, low self-worth, and peer victimization/ rejection are implicated. Such process-oriented find- ings may aid with intervention (see O’Grady & Hinshaw, 2021, for commentary).

Regarding unplanned pregnancy, Owens and Hin- shaw (2020) found that mid-adolescent academic underachievement was part of a serial mediation pathway, whereby childhood ADHD predicted low academic performance in mid-adolescence, which in turn mediated late-adolescent engagement in risky sexual behavior, with resultant high rates of unplanned pregnancy. In addition, low academic performance in adolescence mediated the linkage between childhood ADHD and the later experience of intimate partner   violence.

Finally, Owens and Hinshaw (2016) presented a complex set of serial, indirect effect, mediator mod- els, from childhood neurocognitive vulnerability through early- and late-adolescent psychological processes and then to internalizing/externalizing comorbidity in adulthood. Such comorbidity was marked by adolescent paths incorporating (a) poor self-control/delay of gratification and (b) academic underachievement/school failure. In all, relevant developmental processes for females are variegated, embedded in intraindividual, family-related, and school contexts.


**Unresolved issues and core recommendations for future directions**
**Unresolved issues**
First, given significant female impairments linked with ADHD, a core issue is whether girls and women should be diagnosed in relation to overall norms (emanating from both males and females) versus female-specific norms. With the latter, girls would more easily meet symptom thresholds, as they would be compared with the ‘lower bar’ of average female levels of ADHD symptoms. A parallel argument might be made for depression in males: More men would be diagnosed if their symp- toms were compared with male norms, partly redressing the doubled female:male sex ratio for depression that begins in adolescence. Yet we urge caution. It would need to be definitively established that girls qualifying for an ADHD diagnosis (or men, for depression) on the basis of sex-specific norms reveal clear impairments. Otherwise, rates of diag- nosis in females with ADHD could become overin- flated. In the absence of such evidence, it may be preferable to ensure that (a) diagnostic items reflect both male- and female-specific manifestations, (b) subtle indicators of inattention/disorganization are probed, and (c) clinicians inquire about such factors as compensatory behaviors and life transitions in girls and women .

Second, we note that important issues of culture, diversity, and stigma with regard to ADHD need amplification. Despite critics’ contentions that ADHD is an exclusive product of  major  pressures for  educational  and  vocational  success,  Western culture, unresponsive schools (including compul- sory education), or lax parenting, the relatively consistent prevalence rates around the world (Polanczyk et al., 2007) and the strong contributions of psychobiological risk factors argue otherwise. Still, rates and types of various treatments vary substan- tially around the world. As well, cultural and social forces markedly affect personal and family acceptance as well as adaptation – as well as high rates of diagnosed prevalence in the United States (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014). Far too little is known about the experience of ADHD in non-Western/post-industrial cultures and in racial groups beyond Whites. Espe- cially given increased recognition and diagnosis of ADHD in Black youth and lower- SES individuals (Hinshaw & Scheffler, 2014), it is essential to include diverse participants in research investigations, including girls and women with ADHD beyond middle-class, majority individuals.

As for stigma, a review by Nguyen and Hinshaw (2020) highlights considerable evidence for public stigma, internalized stigma, and associated stigma for youth and adults with ADHD (for a general review, see Martinez & Hinshaw, 2016; for negative adult attitudes regarding youth ADHD, see Pescoso- lido et al., 2008). Despite the belief that stigmatiza- tion is reserved for psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia, it is highly likely that disorders marked by inconsistency of performance, like ADHD, can fuel harsh castigation – perhaps because of the belief that insufficient effort is the underlying cause. Furthermore, for girls and women, traditionally valued for social skills and cohesion, interpersonal difficulties related to ADHD may be particularly stigmatized.

Third, space limitations preclude any kind of sys- tematic review of sex differences in ADHD-related treatment response. Evidence does not reveal major differences in female versus male responses to psy- chosocial or pharmacologic interventions. In a recent review of medications, Kok, Groen, Fuermaier, and Tucha (2020) found that girls with ADHD were less likelyto be treatedwithmedicationsthanboys (see also Mowlem, Rosenqvist, et al., 2019), yet overall results revealed sex-equivalent outcomes in response to med- ication. Still, females appear to encounter more adverse reactions to stimulants and may respond preferentially to nonstimulants like selective nore- pinephrine reuptake inhibitors. And, in the largest clinical trial ever conducted for children with ADHD, including 20% girls among its 579 participants, both behavioral and stimulant medication-related treat- ment effects were not moderated by sex (MTA Cooper- ative Group, 1999). Yet female samples or subsamples are sufficiently small in most investigations to preclude detection of sex-specific findings.

Authoritative sources such as Quinn and Madhoo (2014) and Young et al. (2020) caution that psychosocial interventions should be tailored to female-specific manifestations and sensibilities (e.g., prioritizing group interventions, focusing on inattention and on relationship issues). A model intervention in this regard is the Child Life and Attention Skills curriculum, designed for both boys and girls with the Inattentive presentation. It revealed positive benefits in a randomized controlled trial. Finally, unless girls and women are accurately detected for ADHD during the evaluation and diagnostic process, they may never receive evidence-based treatments.


**Recommendations and brief research agenda**
Based on the preceding review, we present a brief, bullet-point listing of recommended practices regarding assessment and treatment, as well as research priorities.

Regarding evaluation and assessment:

The assumption that girls and women simply do not exhibit ADHD – or do so only rarely – is no longer tenable.

A thorough, evidence-based evaluation is essen- tial, including assessment of comorbid behav- ioral, emotional, and learning issues.

Many assessment scales laden are with items emphasizing male forms of ADHD but do not focus sufficiently on potential female-relevant behaviors (e.g., hyper-verbal behavior versus overly active physical behavior). Moreover, teach- ers may underreport ADHD symptoms in girls. Many girls with actual ADHD may be hard to identify given their tendency to present with exclusive inattention, relative lack of  externaliz- ing behaviors, comorbid presence of anxiety and/ or depression, and use of compensatory strate- gies and family supports that may mask core symptoms (see Young et al., 2020, who also emphasize that highly structured environments can mask ADHD).

Times of life transition – to formal schooling, secondary education, challenging university/ vocational venues; economic independence; and pregnancy/childbearing – may well be triggering of symptom exacerbation. Thus, developmental histories are essential.

Evaluation of strengths in the assessment pro- cess is crucial, as their elucidation may be important targets for treatment planning.

Regarding treatment:
Families of girls with ADHD are marked  by stress, discordant parenting, and potential inval- idation of their daughter. Parent man- agement interventions (including emotion regu- lation skills for parents), combined with school based programs and active promotion of social skills, are evidence-based ideals.

There are no definitive data that ADHD medica- tions reveal greatly different effects in females than males, although nonstimulants may be indicted more in girls and women.

Beyond symptom reduction, treatments should emphasize academic engagement/skills, moni- toring of peer interactions, reduction in risk for maltreatment, and building of self-concept (not falsely but through development of competen- cies). Education around sexuality, protected sex, and prevention of partner violence are also clearly in order.

In terms of research priorities:
A key direction should be not only more precise estimates of sex differences in symptoms and impairments but also female-specific elucidation of heterotypically continuous developmental pathways to self-harm, relationship difficulties, unplanned pregnancy, and  subsequent  parent- ing of the next generation. Although expensive, prospective longitudinal research is necessary for such elucidation.

Greater female representation (of both parents and offspring) is needed in genetic and epigenetic investigations; in follow-up of prenatal and peri- natal risk factors; and in studies of the roles of parenting practices, parenting stress, and par- ental psychopathology. Also, studies of biological and psychosocial changes related to transitions to puberty and subsequently to childbirth and childrearing – as well as perimenopause and menopause in women – are sorely needed.

In the transition to adolescence and adulthood, self-report is more widely utilized for assessment than exclusively informant report. Additional research is needed on the validity of self-report, particularly for adolescent girls and women.  It may be that female self-report is more accurate than that of men, with implications for the decreasing sex ratio of ADHD diagnosis by adulthood.

Determination of later life health risks, including neurodegenerative disorders – along with rele- vant underlying mechanisms – is a priority. Far too little is known about such topics, particularly in women.

In closing, we hope that our review has highlighted the importance of ADHD in girls and women, the ways in which the historical neglect of this popula- tion has at last inspired renewed research and clinical efforts, and the importance of examining female-specific mechanisms and trajectories beyond the search for sex differences per se. There is much to gain, scientifically and clinically, by full represen- tation of the sexes (as well as other crucial individual and cultural differences) in future efforts within this and other domains of psychopathology.
