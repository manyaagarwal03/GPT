Corey D. Pierce, Ph.D.,and Robert Reid, Ph.D.

ABSTRACT

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is now thought to affect from 3 to 7% of school-age children. Children with ADHD will often experience serious problems functioning in the school environment. More and more children from culturally diverse groups are being diagnosed as having ADHD. Research shows that culture can directly affect both assessment and treatment of ADHD. This article provides an overview of the effects of cultural differences on the assessment and treatment of ADHD. Children from diverse cultural groups may be overidentified as having ADHD. Cultural difference may also have an impact on access to treatment and compliance with treatment programs. Recommendations for practitioners are included.

KEYWORDS: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cultural differences, assessment, treatment



Learning Outcomes: As a result of this activity, the reader will be able to (1) describe problems that arise in the differential diagnosis of ADHD in children from culturally diverse backgrounds and (2) summarize recommenda- tions for best practice in treatment of children having ADHD and from culturally diverse backgrounds.

ADHD is a condition characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention or hyperactive- impulsive behavior, or both, that interfere with developmentally appropriate social, academic, or occupational functioning. Research has demonstrated that children with ADHD are at a higher risk of experiencing negative life out- comes from childhood through adulthood, such as performing poorly in school, dropping out of school, teen pregnancy, and lower occupational attainment, than do children who do not have ADHD. Research has also demonstrated that ADHD is one of the most common dis- orders in childhood, affecting approximately 3 to 7% (1.5 to 3.7 million) of the children in the United States.

The composition of the students in the American education system is becoming in- creasingly diverse. The 2000 U.S. Census shows that 22% of the school-age population (grades K through 12) was from culturally different groups (i.e., Asian American, African American, Hispanic American, and so on), an increase of 5% since 1980. As a result, the cultural composition of students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) has also changed. During the 1999 to 2000 school year approximately 40% of students receiving special education services under IDEA were from culturally different groups. It is difficult to estimate the exact percentage of students with ADHD that are from culturally different groups. Before 1991, students who were diagnosed with ADHD were not eligible to receive special education services unless they had a co-occurring disability (e.g., learning disability, physical disability). In 1991, a mem- orandum from the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) stated that students with ADHD were eligible for special education services under the classifica- tion of Other Health Impaired (OHI). From 1991 to 2001, the number of students receiving services under the OHI category increased 351%. OHI now accounts for approximately 15% of the total special education population, with most of those students having ADHD. Records show that more than 25% of the students in the OHI category are from culturally different groups. These figures demonstrate that as the school-age population continues to grow more diverse, the population of students with ADHD also becomes more diverse.

The cultural composition of students in special education is a controversial issue. Re- search on the cultural background of students in specific special education categories has shown that culturally insensitive assessment practices may result in disproportionate representation. For example, in the *Larry P. v. Riles* court case that was filed against the state of California in 1979 by African American parents, they argued that the administration of culturally biased

standardized intelligence tests resulted in the disproportionate identification of African American children as mentally retarded and inappropriate placement in special education classes for the Educable Mentally Retarded (EMR). The court ruled against the use of intelligence tests for African American children for placement in EMR classes or their substan- tial equivalent. Other court cases have also challenged special education assessment meth- ods. *Diana v. State Board of Education* was a case in which the use of tests to place students in special education was again challenged. Diana, a Spanish-speaking student, had been placed in a class for mildly mentally retarded students because she had scored low on an IQ test given to her in English. The court ruled that Spanish-speaking children should be re- tested in their native language to avoid errors in placement. These court cases demonstrate some of the problems that may occur when children from culturally different groups are assessed.

Treatment issues have also been raised for children from culturally different groups who receive treatment for disorders. Research has demonstrated differences in treatment seeking behaviors, access to treatment, and effects of treatment for children from culturally different groups. In terms of treatment-seeking behav- iors, African American children make far fewer visits to physician offices than do their European American peers. Children from cul- turally different groups discontinue treatment service before completion at a much higher rate than do European Americans. Research has also demonstrated differential access to treat- ment for children from culturally different groups. For example, Bosco et al examined variations of medication treatment for children with asthma. They found that even when simi- lar medical services were provided, a lower proportion of prescriptions were given to African American children compared with European American children. Differences have also been found when the effects of treat- ments for disorders received by children from culturally different groups are examined. Bond found that Asian Americans report more side effects when given the same dose of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication than European Americans do. In addition, Lawson found that African Americans have a tendency to respond more quickly to both antipsychotic and antidepressant medications than European Americans do. Thus, there are very real differences associated with the treat- ment of disorders when individuals come from culturally different backgrounds.

The assessment and treatment of children for ADHD are critical tasks with major med- ical, educational, social, and legal conse- quence. As the number of children from culturally different groups in public schools continues to increase, the complexity of asses- sing children for ADHD will also increase. The purpose of this article is to examine cultural factors that might affect the assessment and treatment of children from culturally different groups for ADHD and to discuss the implica- tions of this information for practitioners who may work with these children.


**ASSESSMENT**

Experts have developed a variety of assessment methods designed to diagnose ADHD. The limitations of each method can be minimized by using multiple methods and sources of information collected across settings.There are four main methods used to assess a child for ADHD: (1) conducting clinical interviews, (2) completing behavior rating scales, (3) conduct- ing direct behavioral observations, and (4) con- ducting psychological and psychoeducational assessment. We focus on the use of behavior rating scales for two reasons. First, behavior rating scales are well-researched and are widely used in the ADHD assessment process. Second, this is the only assessment method for which cross-cultural comparisons are available.


**Behavior Rating Scales**

Behavior rating scales, such as the Behavior Assessment System for Children and the Child Behavior Checklist, are used during the assessment process because they can provide more reliable and objective data than what is provided through interviews. In addition, these instruments allow for normative compar- isons, which is also useful in the assessment process. The use of rating scales allows the diagnostician to gather information from a variety of sources regarding the extent to which a child exhibits certain characteristics relative to his or her peers. Behavior rating scales are generally completed by parents, teachers, or others who know the child well, or a combina- tion of these.

**Cultural Considerations and Implications**

Two main issues arise when children from culturally different groups are assessed for ADHD. First, there is the possibility of rater bias. (Note that the term bias is used in the measurement sense and refers to systematic error which can over or under estimate true scores.) Sonuga-Barke and colleaguesdescribe two ways rater bias can affect assessment: (1) individuals from culturally different groups conducting assessments may have a different understanding of what constitutes disorder or may use different criteria to diagnose the same disorder, and (2) the same individual may diagnose people from culturally different groups differently even when they present the same type of symptoms in equal severity. Research has demonstrated that rater bias has occurred. Sonuga-Barke and colleaguesex- amined teacher behavior ratings of English and Asian children. Although Asian children were observed to actually present fewer hyperactive behaviors, teachers rated equal numbers of English and Asian children as hyperactive. Stevensconducted a simulation study to investigate the ratings of ADHD by school psychologists, parents, and teachers. He found that ratings were affected by the cultural char- acteristics of the African American, European American, and Hispanic American partici- pants. More recently, Mann and colleaguesfound that rating of childrenâs behavior by mental health professionals and teachers dif- fered significantly across cultural groups. Their results showed that, after viewing the same videotape vignettes, raters from China and Indonesia scored behaviors significantly higher (i.e., more deviant) than did raters from America and Japan. These studies demonstrate that rater bias may influence the rate at which children from culturally different backgrounds are diagnosed with ADHD.

The second issue that arises concerns nor- mative use of behavior rating scales in the assessment process. Behavior rating scales were developed without consideration of cultural differences.As a result, there are serious concerns pertaining to their normative use with culturally different groups. Individuals from culturally different backgrounds are not adequately represented in the norm groups of many of the available behavior rating scales.Moreover, several studies have found significant differences in the rating scales scores of European American and African American children. As a result, African Americans are approximately 2.5 times more likely to screen positive for ADHD than are European Americans.However, these differences do not typically occur in the case of Hispanic students. The implications of this assessment infor- mation for practitioners and professionals are far reaching. The differences between African Americans and European Americans are evi- dent even when other factors (e.g., socioeco- nomic status) are controlled. At present, it is uncertain whether this reflects a real difference in prevalence between these two populations or other factors such as rater bias. However, be- cause of the possibility of rater bias, diagnostic teams must be certain to gather information from as many sources as possible. Doing so may limit the possible effects of biased assessment on the diagnostic decisions made for children from culturally different groups.Practitioners should be certain that the norm group of rating scales contains a sample of children from the cultural group of the child to be assessed. Although doing this may not completely ensure a valid normative comparison, it should result in a more accurate assessment of the child.Another concern arises when nonâEnglish- speaking parents are asked to complete behav- ior rating scales. Obviously, the validity of results in this situation would be questionable. Luckily some rating scales are now being trans- lated into other languages. For example, the ADHD Rating Scale IVnow provides Spanish versions.

**TREATMENT**

A variety of effective treatments exist for chil- dren with ADHD.Treatments for children with ADHD range from parent counseling and training to psychopharmacological interven- tions.The next section will provide a brief description of treatments available for children with ADHD, followed by a discussion of the relationship between culture and treatment and the implications for practitioners.

**Parent Counseling and Training**

Few parents have the specialized knowledge and skills necessary to effectively deal with ADHD behaviors.Thus, educating parents about ADHD and effective management stra- tegies is now recommended practice.Parent training ranges from comprehensive training programs developed specifically to teach par- ents behavior management skillsto specific counseling that will allow parents to address issues that may be hindering their ability to deal effectively with their childâs behavior.

Client Education and Counseling Educating children with ADHD about their disorder and its effects is an important part of the treatment process.Providing client edu- cation can help children develop an under- standing of how attention, memory, and learning processes work and enhance their learning and academic performance.Educa- tional programs such as those developed by Levine have been used to help children with ADHD understand their disorder and learn how they can improve their lives.

**Pharmacological Treatment**

Research has demonstrated that between 52 and 71% of youths with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD are treated with stimulant medication for this disorder some time before reaching adulthood. As a result, pharmacological treatments for ADHD are the most studied treatment type for children with ADHD.More than 170 studies have been conducted to examine the effects of stimulant medications alone.

Stimulant medications (e.g., methylpheni- date) are the most prescribed type of pharma- cological treatment to treat ADHD because they are the only treatment to demonstrate the potential to normalize inattentive, impul- sive, and restless behavior in children.In addition, stimulants have been shown to im- prove classroom behavior and academic perfor- mance, improve interaction with teachers and family, and decrease irritability and anxiety.The use of multimodal therapy (i.e.,integrating pharmacotherapy with several educational or psychotherapeutic approaches) can maximize the chances of long-term adjustment.

**Cultural Considerations and Implications**

Cultural issues can have a significant impact on the treatment of ADHD.One area of im- portance is that of treatment-seeking behaviors, which refers to actively seeking services to treat the symptoms of ADHD.Treatment-seeking behaviors may differ among cultural groups, leading to different types of treatment received and unequal access to care. For example, evi- dence suggests that African Americans may view ADHD as a behavioral problem rather than as a mental health disorder.Therefore, they may see ADHD symptoms as a problem that should be managed within the family context, rather than seeking outside assistance. In addition, research has shown that African Americans have higher tolerance levels of ADHD symptoms than do European Americans.As a result, African Americans may not seek treatment for children with ADHD symptoms.Moreover, when treat- ment is sought, it is usually not from profes- sional mental health providers but rather from nonprofessional supports.Because African Americans prefer nonprofessional services, African American youths make far fewer phy- sician visits than do their European American peers. As a result, there is a trend for under- treatment of African Americans for ADHD.Research has also demonstrated differences among individuals from different cultures once they have sought out treatment. Different be- liefs about ADHD and the need for treatment may affect treatment cooperation (i.e.,following through with prescribed treatment interventions).African Americans are at a greater risk of terminating overall mental health services, such as those sought for treatment of ADHD symptoms, sooner than are European Americans.Limited research has shown that African Americans are less likely to be compliant with medication treatment because of economic factors, lack of availability of providers, or lack of knowledge about the proper implementation of medications.

Research also demonstrates differences among cultural groups in access to and use of medications to treat ADHD. African Americans have less access to medical services, particularly psychopharmacology in mental health systems.Zito and colleaguesfound that European Americans were prescribed psy- chotropic medications at 2.5 times the rate of African American participants. Differences in the use of psychotropic drugs by individuals from different cultures occur despite control- ling for access to medical services, medications, and lower service use.

There may be significant differences among some cultural groups in response to medication, such as their ability to metabolize or respond to psychotropic medications such as those used to treat ADHD (e.g., methylpheni- date).Some believe the cultural differences in clinical response to pharmacological medica- tions may be a result of a higher prevalence of slow metabolizers in minority populations.Although research has shown stimulant medi- cations to be effective for African Americans, it also has shown that African Americans may be at greater risk for medication side effects and adverse consequences than European Americans are.

**Cultural Considerations and Implications**

There are several implications that are relevant for practitioners and professionals. First, pro- viding education to families of children from culturally different groups who have ADHD (and to those who will work closely with these children) about the nature of ADHD as a mental health disorder that is best treated by professionals (e.g., mental health clinicians) may improve treatment outcomes. Providing this education may increase the number of children with ADHD from culturally different backgrounds who are treated by medical pro- fessionals and increase the percentage of these children who follow through the entire treat- ment cycle. In addition, clinicians should seek to educate themselves about cultural differences so they may be better able to serve individuals from culturally different groups who have ADHD. This cultural education may also im- prove cliniciansâ ability to recognize when an individual from a culturally different group may need treatment.Second, barriers to treatment need to be addressed. Determining which bar- riers (e.g., lack of funds or insurance, limited access to mental health care services) are im- peding treatment of ADHD and addressing them will help to ensure that children with ADHD from culturally different groups have access to adequate care. Third, because research has demonstrated that individuals from cultu- rally different groups discontinue treatment at a high rate, it will be important for practitioners and professionals to develop motivational tools and educational programs to increase adherence to treatment. Increasing treatment adherence may improve the outcomes. One suggestion in the literature is that the cultural matching of participants and therapists may improve treat- ment adherence and outcome.Fourth, in situations in which practitioners and profes- sionals are working directly with children from culturally different groups with ADHD who are receiving pharmacological treatment, it may be beneficial to closely monitor their behavior and mental and physical health. Doing so may help catch any harmful side effects early so adjustments can be made.


**CONCLUSION**

When assessing and treating children from culturally different groups, it is evident that extra precautions must be taken. As the litera- ture demonstrates, there are situations in which proven differences among individuals from culturally different groups exist and many other situations in which cultural differences may affect the assessment and treatment of ADHD. It is the responsibility of practitioners and professionals who work with these children to educate themselves so they can provide the most appropriate, unbiased assessment and most effective treatment possible.
