The relations between attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and motor skills are well documented, with research indicating both early and lifelong motor deficits in children with this disorder. Despite neuroanatomical and neurodevelopmental differences, which may predict differential rates of motor impairment between ADHD subtypes, evaluation of motor skill deficits in children with different presentations are limited in scope and equivocal in findings. The present investigation evaluated early motor development history and objectively measured motor skills in children with ADHD- Inattentive subtype (ADHD-I) and ADHD-Combined subtype (ADHD-C). One hundred and one children with ADHD-I (*n* = 53) and ADHD-C (*n* = 48) were included. Variables included Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), history of motor delays, and utilization of early intervention services, as well as objectively measured motor impairment as assessed via tasks of fine- motor coordination. No between-group differences were found for FSIQ, but differences in age emerged, with the ADHD-I group being older. No differences in early motor delays were observed, though a considerably higher percentage of children with ADHD-C demonstrated early difficulties. Surprisingly, although children and adolescents with ADHD-C reported more frequent utilization of early intervention services, those with ADHD-I exhibited greater levels of current motor impairment on objective tasks. Given the over-representation of older children in the ADHD-I group, data were reanalyzed after excluding participants older than 10 years of age. Although the between-group differences were no longer significant, more than twice the number of parents of children with ADHD-C reported early motor delays, as compared with the ADHD-I group. Overall, children with ADHD-I were more likely to exhibit current objectively measured motor impairment, possibly due to later identification, less intervention, and/or different neurodevelopmental substrates underlying this disorder subtype.


**INTRODUCTION**

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental disorder char- acterized by attentional difficulties “more frequently dis- played and more severe than is typically observed in indi- viduals at comparable level of development” . While ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed pediatric disor- der, prevalence estimates vary depending on the popula- tion studied (e.g., community samples, school samples, clinically referred samples). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (2000), epidemiological studies suggest that 9.2% of boys and 2.9% of girls demonstrate behaviors consistent with the diagnosis. As currently defined by the *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders*-Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM- IV-TR), symptoms of ADHD must be present before the age of 7, clinically significant in at least two settings, and cause functional impairment. Symptomatology can be further categorized by the disorder’s predominant behav- ioral features, including a Hyperactive–Impulsive sub- type (ADHD-HI), an Inattentive subtype (ADHD-I), and a Combined presentation (ADHD-C). ADHD-HI requires six of nine symptoms of hyperactivity or impul- sivity, including difficulty with inhibiting impulses, turn taking, interrupting, and keeping still. ADHD-I is defined as exhibiting six of nine symptoms including inattention, distractibility, disorganization, and reduced capacity for sustained mental effort. Lastly, ADHD-C requires six of nine symptoms in both the ADHD-HI and ADHD-I subtype symptoms. Multiple population studies have shown that ADHD-I is the most commonly diagnosed (1.6%–9.9%), followed by ADHD-C (0.6%–3.6%), and with ADHD-HI being least common (0.2%–2.4). However, prevalence rates vary based on age, with ADHD-C being more prevalent in younger age groups.

Although all three subtypes are currently considered to be part of a unified diagnostic entity, there has been a growing debate as to whether the ADHD-HI, ADHD-I, and ADHD-C constitute distinct disorders. The principle of equifinality states that individuals can arrive at the same outcome via different combinations of vulnerability and risk. In this vein, several investigators have suggested that ADHD-I is neurobio- logically distinct from ADHD-C and ADHD-HI and thus constitutes a separate disorder altogether. More specifically, fronto-striatal networks have been implicated in ADHD-C, with functional imaging studies reporting smaller caudate volumes, reversed caudate asymmetry, and general deficits in basal ganglia. In contrast, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and fronto-parietal networks have been hypothesized to be the primary source of disruption in ADHD-I (Diamond). Symptomatically, each subtype’s distinct neuroanatomical underpinning is reflected in the unique neuropsychological profile expressed by those affected. For example, while children with ADHD-C have been shown to demonstrate a primary deficit in behavioral inhibition, children with ADHD-I are more likely to show working-memory deficits.

The increased incidence of motor skill deficits in children with ADHD has also been well established, with developmental motor difficulties present in as many as 50% of children with ADHD. Accordingly, developmental coor- dination disorder (DCD) is over-represented in this pop- ulation, interfering with both the completion of activities of daily living (ADLs) and academic achievement, conse- quently placing the children at increased risk for learning difficulties and negative social-emotional development. Children with DCD perform activities requiring motor coordination at a level that is substantially below expectation based on their chronological age and intelligence. Marked delays in achieving motor milestones (sitting, crawling, walking), “clumsiness,” and poor handwriting are all hallmarks of this disorder.

Several investigators have proposed theories explaining the neurodevelopmental relationship between thought, motor skills, attentional impairment, and executive func- tioning and the presumed pathophysiology of ADHD. One such broad-based conceptualization implies that an early disruption in brain development results in impair- ments in both motor and attentional domains (Kaplan, Wilson, Dewey, & Crawford, 1998), with the nature of the deficits owing to the timing and severity of the delay. Reasons beyond those ascribed to a perva- sive delay of neuroanatomical development have also been proposed. Specifically, children with motor skills deficits (and DCD diagnosis) tend to exhibit greater motor coordination difficulties on complex tasks, as well as those tasks involving sacrificing speed for accuracy or a time delay, as such measures require inhibitory control to generate the correct motor response. Likewise, behavioral inhibition, the requisite foundation for all executive functioning, is inexorably linked to the motor system in the completion of goal-directed behavior. The development of executive functioning is associated with a child’s increasing ability to control their thoughts and actions. In the simplest terms, executive functioning develops from the motor system to control it. According to Sergeant (2000), his “cognitive-energetic” model of infor- mation processing can further be used to explain the link between executive and motor functioning and ADHD. In this model, the first level consists of central processing, encoding, and response organization, which, in turn, is involved in motor organization (Sergeant & van der Meere, 1990). The second level, or “energetic pools,” is composed of arousal, activation, and effort. The third and final level, which mediates the system of executive functioning, reviews performance and corrects errors. By extension, the management of the executive level of processing underlies the planning, monitoring, and error correction of motor organization. According to Sergeant, although the first level of cognitive processing may not be affected in children with ADHD, there will be collateral impact on motor organization.

The differential rates of motor impairment and/or DCD among ADHD subtypes (i.e., ADHD-I and ADHD-C) can be further used as a “real-world” clinical illustration of the neurodevelopmental models proposed earlier. For example, it has been well described that the primary deficit in ADHD-I involves working memory, or holding information “online” for later use. Children with ADHD-I can and do develop comorbid motor coordina- tion deficits, as the connections between the parietal lobe and PFC support working-memory functions at the cortical level, whereas movement is guided by simultane- ous and synergistic interactions between the parietal lobe and the PFC, which uses these parameters for developing motor programs during the course of development. Therefore, children with ADHD-I lack the necessary sup- portive scaffolding to preserve the content information from the parietal-frontal “online” system to guide action, resulting in the attentional, executive, and coordination deficits often exhibited in children with ADHD-I.

In contrast, other findings, such as those described by Meyer and Sagvolden, suggest more pronounced impairment in children with ADHD-C on complex, fine-motor tasks of accuracy and speed. Such differences were hypothesized to be due to the greater demands of complex motor skills on sustained attention, which is disrupted by the hallmarks of ADHD-C—inattention and impulsivity. Similarly, it has also been found that motor dif- ficulties are present in children with more severe ADHD-C, as are secondary neurodevelopmental and behavioral diffi- culties, including related thought, social, and attention problems.

Given the differences in epidemiological expression, neuroanatomical underpinnings, and neurodevelopmen- tal conceptualization, it can be reasonably assumed that there would be a different range and scope of motor-based difficulties in ADHD subtypes (i.e., ADHD-C vs. ADHD- I). However, a review of the extant literature yields incon- sistent results. While several studies have identified increased motor problems in individuals with ADHD-I, others indicate more frequent, severe motor deficits in those with a combined presentation. Additionally, some findings suggest that children with ADHD-I tend to present with fine-motor weaknesses, whereas gross-motor defi- cits have been found to be more prevalent in children with ADHD-C.

Partitioning heterogeneity in children with ADHD and co-occurring motor skills dysfunction (e.g., presence or absence of early and/or current impairment) is a neces- sary step toward examining whether these subgroups are associated with distinct outcomes. Such an investigation would yield a better understanding of comorbidity and shared etiology to facilitate more precise methods for assessment and intervention. To this end, the present investigation evaluated early motor development history and objectively measured current motor skills in children with different subtypes of ADHD. Early motor impair- ment was determined in a group of clinically referred children with ADHD to ascertain whether children with ADHD-I differed in the level of early motor delays from those with ADHD-C. Given the relatively low prevalence rates of ADHD-HI in the general population, as reflected by the referrals to our centers, children with ADHD-HI were not included in the study. The goals of the present study were twofold. First, we compared the two ADHD groups in terms of their respective history of develop- mental motor delay and utilization of early intervention services. Second, the level of current motor impairment was assessed with objective motor tasks and was compared across groups. Given that striatal networks have been implicated in both motor coordination and ADHD-C (Castellanos, 1997; Castellanos et al., 2002; Graybiel, Aosaki, Flaherty, & Kimura, 1994; Overmeyer et al., 2001; Schrimsher et al., 2002), we hypothesized that children exhibiting this subtype will demonstrate greater levels of current and early motor impairment, as well as higher levels of received early intervention services, com- pared with their counterparts with ADHD-I.

**METHODS**

**Participants**

The sample was drawn from clinically referred children and adolescents seen for neuropsychological evaluation at the New York University (NYU) Child Study Center or the NYU Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. Records were reviewed retrospectively; institutional review board approval for retrospective review of data in a repository was ascertained. Cases were included if the following criteria were met: (1) a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines; (2) available parent-report history regarding early motor skill development; and (3) a formal test of fine-motor skill had been administered. From the data repositories, 101 children meeting these criteria were identified; 53 children were diagnosed with ADHD-I and 48 children had a diagnosis of ADHD-C. With respect to gender, 74 of the children were boys (73%) and 27 were girls (27%).

**Measures**

Information regarding early motor delay and utilization of early intervention services was gathered via parental report. A child was considered to have early motor delays if they did not walk before 15 months or if parents reported specific delays in acquisition of gross- or fine-motor skills, including handwriting. Children who received physical or occupational therapy at any time before completing third grade were considered to have received early intervention services. Current motor impairment was considered if a child obtained a *z*-score greater than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean (i.e., 7th percentile) on any formal measure of fine-motor coordination with either hand (i.e., Grooved Pegboard, Purdue Pegboard, or Wide Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities [WRAMVA] Pegboard). Although most children were administered the Grooved Pegboard, dif- ferent clinicians at the participating sites administered other tests of fine-motor coordination. Given that each of these measures are pegboard-based tasks, are stan- dardized and well-validated measures of fine-motor coordination, and possess a relatively high correlation between similar motor tasks (Baron, 2004), it was deter- mined that impairment on any of the three measures would qualify as the presence of motor impairment. An objectively measured value of fine-motor impairment (i.e., *z*-score on pegboard task) was selected as the depen- dent variable rather than a DSM-IV diagnosis of DCD, as multiple examiners were involved in this study, result- ing in questionable interrater reliability of this fairly subjective DSM-IV diagnosis.

**Statistical Analysis**

Independent-samples *t*-tests were used to assess whether the cohorts of children with ADHD-I and ADHD-C were equivalent in terms of age, gender, and Full Scale IQ.

Chi-square analyses assessed whether group differences existed in the rates of early motor delay, early intervention services received, and current motor impairment.

**RESULTS**

Table 1 describes the characteristics of the studied sample. The ADHD-C and ADHD-I groups differed in age, with the ADHD-I group being significantly older (*t* = 5.72, *p* < .001), but they did not differ in terms of gender (U = 1.36, *p* = .412). IQ scores were available for 48 chil- dren in the ADHD-I group and 43 children in the ADHD-C group; Full-Scale IQ also did not differ between the groups (*t* = 1.23, *p* = .224).

Overall, 22% of the sample had a history of early motor delays and 26% received services to address their motor deficits. Our findings showed that there was no dif- ference in the rates of early motor development between the two groups (c*2* = 1.51, *p* = .219), although more chil- dren with ADHD-C demonstrated early motor delays as per parent report (27% ADHD-C vs. 17% ADHD-I). In contrast, although the groups did not differ significantly in the rates of early motor impairment, the frequency of children receiving early intervention services was signifi- cantly different between groups. In particular, children with ADHD-C were 2 times more likely to have received early intervention services such as occupational therapy compared with those with ADHD-I (35% ADHD-C vs. 17% ADHD-I; c*2* = 4.48, *p* = .034). When the data were reviewed in their entirety, 51% of participants exhibited evidence of fine-motor deficits, as measured by impairment on pegboard tasks. A significant between-group difference emerged with regard to current fine-motor skill impairment. Although it was anticipated that children with ADHD-C would demonstrate greater levels of impairment on fine-motor tasks, our results reflected the opposite, with the ADHD-I group perform- ing more poorly on measures of fine-motor coordination (c*2* = 4.36, *p* = .037; 40% ADHD-C vs. 60% ADHD-I).

Given that the ADHD-I group was significantly older, we hypothesized that children originally diagnosed with ADHD-C may have outgrown some of their hyperactive and impulsive features and were subsequently reclassified as ADHD-I. To address this potential confound, we reanalyzed study data after excluding all children who were older than 10 years of age. The resulting sample consisted of 35 children diagnosed with ADHD-C and 17 children diagnosed with ADHD-I; this reduced our sample size by half and likely underpowered the analysis. Although this analysis did not reveal any significant differences between groups with regard to any of our variables, a review of the relative frequency of early motor delays (by parent report) was still revealing. When children older than 10 years of age were excluded, more than twice the number of parents of children with ADHD-C reported early motor delays, as compared with the ADHD-I group. Similarly, no significant differences were seen in the provision of early intervention service (c*2* = 2.6, *p* = .107). However, this linear trend was quite notable for its clinical implications. Whereas 40% of chil- dren with ADHD-C received early intervention services, only 18% of those with ADHD-I received such services. Lastly, 47% of children with ADHD-I demonstrated presence of motor impairment on evaluation versus 31% of the ADHD-C group; however, this finding did not reach statistical significance (c*2* = 1.21, *p* = .272). Table 3 shows chi-square analyses for the between-group analysis for children aged 10 and younger.

**DISCUSSION**

The relationship between ADHD and motor skills is well documented, with research indicating both early and persisting motor skill deficits in children with this disor- der. However, ours is among the first to evaluate early motor development history and objectively measured current motor skills in children with ADHD-I and ADHD-C. Although a significant difference in the rates of parent-reported motor delays did not emerge between children with ADHD-C and ADHD-I, more children with ADHD-C showed such impairments. Our result indicated that children with ADHD-C were significantly more likely to have received motor-based intervention services in early childhood, while those with ADHD-I were more likely to demonstrate current motor impair- ment as measured by pegboard tests. Although the results did not fully support our hypotheses, this finding is con- sistent with previous research demonstrating increased gross-motor problems in children with ADHD-C. Although the presence of fine-motor skill differences were not in the predicted direction, the implications are nonetheless important for several reasons. First, our findings provide further support for the existing literature, indicating increased gross-motor impairment in the ADHD-C group and increased fine-motor impairment in children with ADHD-I. Second, our data indicate that children with ADHD-I, who have well-documented weaknesses in working memory, may be at additional risk for fine-motor slowing, as this group often requires longer reaction time to stimuli, resulting in the need for additional “read out” time and/or short-term memory capacity. Likewise, the working-memory difficulties often observed in ADHD-I populations may prevent the content of the parieto–PFC connections mediating “action” from being successfully stored “online.” From a more pragmatic perspective, children with ADHD-C are more likely to be disruptive, therefore potentially receiving earlier identifi- cation and treatment, as compared with children with ADHD-I, who are more distractible and inattentive. This possibility has been discussed previously; the diagnosis of ADHD currently requires evidence for symptom onset prior to age 7. However, given the subtlety of ADHD-I deficits, many children with ADHD-I may not meet this specific criteria, exhibiting all other clinically significant may not be identified early enough to be provided with early intervention services.

It is also worth noting that our ADHD-I sample was older than the ADHD-C group, which is consistent with the known developmental trajectory of ADHD. Specifically, as children with ADHD age, their symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity often diminish and/or completely remit, while inattentive symptoms are more likely to persist. While some investigations have suggested that the observed diminution in ADHD symptoms is related to definitional variation (Biederman et al.), others have demonstrated a relationship between clinical symptoms and outcomes and brain development, particularly cortical thickness in the left, medial prefrontal and cingulate cortex. Thus, it is plausible that for some chil- dren, the brain maturation that occurs with age is reflected in less hyperactive and impulsive symptomatology, and as a result, children who previously would have been diagnosed with ADHD-C in early childhood may be diagnosed with ADHD-I at comparatively older ages. As such, the ADHD-I group here may not be representative of a younger cohort with this disease subtype and is therefore not generalizable to a larger, more diverse sample. Given potential confound of age, we reanalyzed our data after excluding children who were older than 10 years old. Although this significantly reduced our sample size and likely underpowered those results, the patterns remained similar. Although no signifi- cant differences between the groups emerged with regard to parent-reported motor delays, utilization of early interven- tion services, or current motor impairment, the directional trends remained the same, with very similar percentages. Overall, children with ADHD-C were more likely to have early motor delays, as well as receive early intervention ser- vices, while a greater number of children with ADHD-I demonstrated current motor impairment.

The present study has several limitations that should be highlighted. First, the investigation relied on retro- spective parent report to define early motor skill deficits. Future prospective, longitudinal investigations are needed to more reliably evaluate the rate at which children with early motor delays develop ADHD. Unfortunately, access to each child’s medical record, which may have included pediatrician-documented early motor delay, was not possible given the retrospective nature of the study, as well as the multicenter data collection. In a similar vein, future studies should include the specific assessment, either by parent report or, ideally, clinician observation, of early motor milestones (e.g., grasping, sitting up, crawling, walking, etc.). Another limitation is that only one type of motor skill (i.e., fine-motor speed and coordi- nation) was objectively assessed; graphomotor control or gross-motor skills were not tested as part of the current battery. Given the evidence for different types of motor skill impairment being implicated in the three ADHD subtypes, this is an important variable to consider in future investigations. Also, boys were over-represented in our sample, resulting in a potential confound and limiting the generalizability of the obtained data. Future studies should attempt to recruit more female participants so that gender ´ ADHD subtype interactions can be more comprehensively explored. Lastly, given that symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity respond well to medication, it is possible that more of the children in the ADHD-C group were receiving medication at the time of testing (as compared with those diagnosed with ADHD-I); however, data regarding current drug treatment regimens were unavailable for this sample given the retrospective nature of data collection. The inability to control for this poten- tial confound is significant, as there is some evidence to suggest that even a single dose of methylphenidate can also help improve motor skills and muscular tone.

Despite these limitations, the current study adds to the extant literature by evaluating motor development in children with ADHD-I and ADHD-C and raises several implications for optimizing clinical care provided to this population. First, our study suggests that there is variability between the presence of early motor delays and the utiliza- tion of early intervention services across ADHD subtypes, whereas children with ADHD-C appear to be more likely to receive services. Although the presence of more “visibly disruptive” hyperactive and impulsive symptoms likely drives earlier identification and diagnosis of motor delays, children and adolescents with ADHD-I may remain untreated, missing the narrow window for effective early intervention services. Alternatively, the specific neuroana- tomical underpinnings of ADHD-I—namely the connec- tions between the parietal-frontal cortices—may result in the different early presentation of this subtype, as com- pared with ADHD-C. Regardless of the reason, this group exhibits a greater frequency of motor impairment over time. Accordingly, clinicians should focus on early interven- tion and monitoring of all children with ADHD, regardless of subtype, even in the absence of early motor delays. This study further supports the finding that children with ADHD are much more likely to demonstrate motor impair- ment compared with those without ADHD, with 51% of our sample exhibiting current fine-motor deficits but only 22% demonstrating early motor delays. Thus, it is important to ensure that children with ADHD are serially monitored for continued motor problems as they get older, so that services can be provided if clinically indicated.
