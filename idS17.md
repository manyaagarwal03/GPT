Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity- impulsivity that interferes with everyday functioning. It occurs in early childhood and, according to the diagnostic criteria, symptoms should be present before the age of 12. However, the diagnosis can be made in any age, even adulthood (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Although its reported prevalence varies by study, it is estimated around 7% in children and constitutes one of the most common referral reasons to child mental health services worldwide. In preschoolers, (children aged 2–5 years old), in particular, the reported prevalence in the community ranges from 2 to 8% while, according to more recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is estimated at 2.7%. Left untreated, it has been associated with subsequent problems in school, difficulties in social functioning and increased risk for comorbid conditions. Early childhood is a crucial period for brain neurodevelop- mental processes. On one hand, brain plasticity and changes appear to be most dynamic and intensive dur- ing the early developmental stages, and, on the other hand, the behavioral manifestations of these neural changes are more prone to interventions as behavioral patterns are not yet consolidated. However, the research on the identification of preschool ADHD remains limited.

**Diagnosing ADHD in preschoolers**
ADHD symptoms usually manifest before the age of 6. However, most cases are diagnosed in school-aged children, where inattention and hyperac- tivity interferes with academic performances and the more structured school environment. This emphasis on older children has most likely resulted from only practical reasons, as, on the one hand, the consequences of symptoms are more evident (i.e., low academic performances, disruptions in learning process) and, on the other hand, diagnosis of ADHD in preschoolers had been for many years considered challenging. One difficulty is that high levels of impulsivity and activity are difficult to distinguish from the expected behaviors in typically developing (TD) toddlers and young children, even by parents and preschool teachers. This is an important pitfall, as the generally accepted diagnostic process for ADHD includes parent and teacher ratings and clinical interviews and observations that probe for core symptoms of the can neuropsychology contribute to the ea"></a><a name="cognition in preschool adhd: how much do disorder. A second difficulty, that pertains especially to younger preschoolers (i.e., aged 3 years old), is that they cannot be reliably interviewed to provide accurate self- information. Although the reliability of preschoolers’ self-reports increases exponentially as the child gets older (i.e., ages 4 and 5), younger preschoolers’ reports might be highly unreliable. A third shortcoming for many years had been the limited availability of assessment instruments for this age group . Therefore, the validity of the preschool diagnosis of ADHD had been debated.

**Feasibility of diagnosing ADHD in preschool children**
Despite the challenges in diagnosing ADHD in children younger than 6 years old, studies support the validity of preschool ADHD diagnosis. In fact, the most recent guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (2011) lay out specific guidelines for the assessment of preschool ADHD. Longitudinal investigations report that a substantial portion of preschoolers with ADHD symptoms (79–89%) meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD in late childhood. The more severe the symptoms are, the higher the stability of diagnoses is through late childhood and adolescence. In fact, a recent study with diagnoses of severe preschool ADHD reported up to 90% stability in the diagnoses in a 6-year follow-up. This is the highest rate of persistence of preschool ADHD diagnosis reported, while another study estimated the stability of preschool ADHD over time at 79%. Thus, even in the former case, a significant minority of preschool children seems to “outgrow” the elevated levels of inattention, impulsivity, and overactivity observed in early childhood. Therefore, although an ADHD diagnosis in preschool years is feasible, there is a significant window of uncertainty as to whether specific young children do, indeed, have ADHD and should, therefore, be treated to prevent negative long-term outcomes.

**Can neuropsychology contribute to the early identification of ADHD?**
Neuroimaging studies revealed differences in brain structure and function that potentially underlie the behavioral patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity observed in ADHD. More specifically,

differences in basal ganglia development, that is, reduced caudate volumes bilaterally, are reported in children with ADHD compared to their TD peers. These developmental deviations may be associated with early onset symptoms of preschool ADHD, such as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Other studies in school age children reported decreased cortical thickness in the anterior cingulum, the superior prefrontal and precentral cortex. Brain dysfunction (i.e.,hypoactivation of the supplementary motor area and basal ganglia) during specific cognitive tasks, as wel as reduced functional connectivity between the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulum, the superior parietal cortex, and the cerebellum was also noted in children with ADHD compared to their TD peers. The aforementioned brain group differences between children with ADHD and their TD peers are only a part of those believed to underlie the clinical manifestations of the disorder. This is consistent with the numerous studies documenting neuropsychological findings in school-aged children and, more recently, preschoolers with ADHD, as neuropsychological assessment is a means to assess brain functioning. However, this approach has been underutilized in younger children. The advantages of such a practice in preschoolers with ADHD symptoms are numerous. First, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations will help us delineate the underlying cognitive deficits in preschool ADHD and understand the cognitive difficulties young children may face. Second, deficits seen in ADHD contribute to current and future functional outcomes (i.e., academic undera- chievement and social dysfunction). Third, and related to the previous, neuropsychological assessments may help us identify different subtypes of ADHD and predict outcome, as different subtypes may be associated with different prognoses. Fourth, longitudinal neuropsychological investigations will help us comprehend the neurodevelopmental nature of the disorder. Each of these arguments is analyzed in the following sections.

**Cognition in preschool ADHD: How much do we really know?**
Data on the patterns of neuropsychological deficits in preschoolers with ADHD symptoms compared to older children remains limited. Only selective cognitive abili- ties have been examined based on the patterns of impairments observed in older children. However, due to the intensive developmental nature of cognition in these age groups, in particular, this approach may be biased. This is due to the fact that not only the severity of cognitive deficits may change as children grow (i.e., working memory may be more or less compromised in older children, compared to the younger), but also the pattern of deficits may differ as even the structure of certain cognitive abilities changes with age (i.e., the factor structure of executive cognition may vary as a function of age).

The studies that do exist support the notion that preschoolers with ADHD have cognitive deficits, but they constitute a neuropsychologically heterogeneous group. As in school age children, deficits in executive functioning seem to be prominent in most preschoolers. In a recent meta-analysis, response inhibition and delay aversion seem to be the abilities most compromised in young children, followed by vigilance/arousal, and interference control. These deficits remained even after controlling for IQ and certain co-morbidities and are believed to underlie ADHD symptoms. Working memory and mental flexibility impairments of smaller magnitude have also been documented. On the other hand, it has been suggested that preschoolers with ADHD do not differ from TD children on executive functioning measures (i.e., response inhibition), in particular, but they have a general poor regulation of their energetic state (arousal, effort, activation), that leads to general deficiencies and not a specific deficit in inhibitory control. These studies view executive cognition deficits as a byproduct of deficits in nonexecutive abilities.

Preschoolers with ADHD, as a group, were further found to perform lower than their TD peers on language comprehension, short-term verbal memory, and motor control tasks, but the evidence is weak. Finally, when examined individually, all neuropsychological measures derived from NEPSY, the most commonly used neuropsychological battery for children aged 3 and above, and a continuous performance task, signifi- cantly distinguished symptomatic preschoolers from TD peers, with effect sizes in the medium to large range.

These findings may, at first, seem inconsistent; in fact, they do reflect the heterogeneity of the clinical

manifestations in this syndrome. Different neuropsy- chological types exist so that not all individuals with ADHD show deficits in the same area of cognitive function. In hyperactive/ inattentive preschoolers, a recent study using latent profile analysis identified two subgroups, one with a relative weakness in attention/ executive cognition, and the other with pervasive neuropsychological dysfunction across measures A dysexecutive and a group with motivational impair- ments (i.e., with defective delay aversion) emerged in two other studies of preschoolers. Further distinct neuropsychological subtypes have been proposed, including one characterized by shortened delayed gradient, another by deficient temporal processing, and another by impaired working memory. Further comprehensive neuropsy- chological studies are needed to evaluate whether impairments in more cognitive domains do exist, the exact magnitude of these impairments, and whether the differences with TD peers are large enough to be detected on an individual level in clinical practice. Finally, the identification of different neuropsychologi- cal subtypes should be further assessed.

**Cognitive correlates of ADHD symptoms and functional outcome in preschoolers with ADHD**
The concurrent relationship between cognition and ADHD symptoms has been thoroughly investigated in children of elementary school age and adolescents and highlighted an association, even modest in some reports, between inattention, in particular, and EC deficits. However, less is known on the potential association between cognition and inattention and impulsivity in the preschool aged population. Inhibition and working memory performance have been found to be associated with symptoms of ADHD in very young children, aged 3–6 years old, and this association was reported to remain stable during an 18-month follow-up. Another study demonstrated that the association between symptoms of ADHD and inhibition and working memory remained, even after controlling for sex and verbal skills. However, the effects sizes were of small magnitude and therefore lack any clinical utility at the person level. In addition to EC, delay aversion was found to independently predict ADHD symptoms, above and beyond age, IQ, and conduct problems. In contrast, an earlier study showed that, among executive cognition abilities, only selective deficits in inhibitory control were associated with ADHD symptoms in the preschool period.

In addition to ADHD symptoms, concurrent everyday functioning, such as social functioning and pre-academic performances, might be associated with cognitive deficits in preschoolers with ADHD. Although there are no studies directly assessing the relationship of functional outcome with cognition in young children diagnosed with ADHD, such relationships have been reported for “hard to manage preschoolers” and school-age children with ADHD. Given the striking similarities of preschool children with school-age children with ADHD in reference to the psychiatric comorbidity, and associated functional and social impairment, this relationship warrants further investigation in preschoolers as well. In addition, executive function deficits and reaction time variability are significant mediators in the relation between ADHD and poor academic achievement in young children. In preschoolers, significant lags in the acquisition of basic academic achievement skills (i.e., arithmetic and reading) compared to peers without ADHD are documented. Thus, it is possible that cognitive deficits may underlie the compromised academic abilities at least in a subsample of persons with ADHD from a very early age.

**Association of cognition with future outcome of preschoolers with ADHD. Can neuropsychological functioning predict the persistence of ADHD diagnosis?**
Children who are extremely inattentive, hyperactive, and impulsive in preschool years may proceed to several possible outcomes. The majority of children seem to retain an ADHD diagnosis; a minority might present mood or anxiety disorders, social withdrawal or primarily learning and achievement problems, and still others exhibit cognitive and emotional strengths and have quite favorable outcomes. Finally, a substantial minority of preschool children with ADHD seem to outgrow their problems and have very successful out- comes. Can neuropsychological functioning profiles predict this variability in outcome?

The relationship of preschool cognitive functioning in symptomatic children with future outcome is far from clear. One study indicated that early difficulties with inhibitory control could explain little of the variance in later inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and social competence. Similarly, although neuropsychological measures distinguished hyperactive preschoolers from their TD peers, the patterns and severity of neuropsychological dysfunction did not predict risk for ADHD during school-age This last study concluded that trajectories in at-risk children are affected by subsequent environmental and neurodevelopmental factors, and are, thus, amenable to early interventions

On the other hand, a series of studies, some of which published recently, highlight the potential contribution of neuropsychological assessment to the prediction of future outcome. When controlling for early ADHD symptom levels, working memory and reaction time variability in preschool significantly predicted inattention even as long as thirteen years later. They, furthermore, predicted academic achievement in late adolescence beyond the influence of early ADHD symptoms. Walcott et al.  noted that early attention problems may delay the acquisition of certain pre-literacy skills, such as phonemic awareness and, thus, contribute to later academic underachievement. In addition, distinct inhibitory processes (i.e, prepotent response inhibition) predicted ADHD symptoms both concurrently and two years later. Finally, a recent study showed that in the preschool period, in which inhibitory control and reward-related functions undergo dramatic changes, neuropsychological deficits preceded and predicted later ADHD symptoms  and rejected the possibility that these deficits develop as a consequence of ADHD symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of early neuropsycho- logical evaluations as a means to identify children who are at risk of future ADHD symptoms and other negative outcomes. Although the evidence is inconclusive, given the high prevalence of ADHD in children and the stability of the preschoolADHD diagnosis, neuropsychological characteristics of preschoolers should be examined as potential risk factors of long-term ADHD. Of interest are also the neuropsychological characteristics of those preschoolers who will not have symptoms in the clinical range in the school years.

**Neuropsychological approaches and the nature of the ADHD**
ADHD is a behaviorally defined disorder. This umbrella terms describes children and adults with attentive problems, and/or hyperactivity and/or impulsivity. It is believed that there is etiological heterogeneity and multiple pathways that contribute to the distinct clinical picture of each person . Like other behaviorally defined disorders, the investigation of its phenotype serves as a starting point to understand its etiology and biological underpinnings. Neuropsychologi- cal procedures enable “objective” behavioral assessments that are highly reliable and help formulate hypotheses of how brain produces behavior. The inter-individual neuropsychological variability in the clinical picture of children with ADHD (some with specific cognitive deficits, other with different, other with none) and the variability in the outcome of preschoolers with ADHD is a promising field of investigation as the distinct neu- ropsychological subtypes that emerged in recent studies may be associated with different etiology and prognosis . In fact, Swanson et al. showed that ADHD children with a long-repeat allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene performed in the normal range, whereas ADHD children without that allele had impaired or slow reaction time performances. Neuropsy- chological profiles may, thus, serve as helpful phenotypes to approach this complex disorder. Comprehensive longitudinal neuropsychological investigations starting at the preschool years are required to help us compre- hend the neurodevelopmental nature of the disorder.


**Discussion**
Preschool years represent a crucial period of extensive growth in brain structure and function that is behaviorally evident as the initial expression of many psychological and cognitive abili- ties. ADHD is a common developmental disorder that manifests in early childhood and even at this young age, children are likely to experience behavioral, social, family, and pre-academic difficulties. A significant majority of symptomatic preschool children face cognitive difficult- ies, among which executive dysfunction is prominent. Neuropsychological assessments have been limited in preschoolers, due to practical difficulties, such as limited availability of appropriate neuropsychological procedures or difficulty to assess small children. Both of these perceptions are now dated. There are age appropriate assessment procedures that enable comprehensive  neuropsychological  evaluations  in preschoolers. Neuropsychological evaluations can prove useful both in clinical practice and research. They can delin- eate the specific cognitive difficulties young children may face, and help design personalized interventions to improve the specific abilities. This is very important as young symptomatic children can benefit by early interventions to avoid or minimize the long-term adverse outcomes of the disorder . Left untreated, and once at school, children with ADHD  will  face  academic  difficulties  and  social problems.

On a theoretical level, neuropsychological profiles may help answer several important questions in the field, such as why some preschoolers outgrow their symptoms, while other will have adverse outcomes. The remission of ADHD symptoms is, furthermore, striking as children enter adolescence and adulthood. Reports on stability of childhood diagnosed ADHD (meeting full diagnostic criteria) range from as low as 5 to 15%, increasing up to 65% only when cases in partial remission are considered ;. Finally, longitudinal neuropsychological investigations will shed light in the initial expression and development of cognition in this complex disorder. Detailed neuropsychological assessments should be integrated in the routine evalua- tions of preschoolers at risk for ADHD. Neuropsycholo- gical evaluations cannot replace the existing diagnostic procedures of this behaviorally defined disorder. Instead, they could assist in its early identification in the preschool years, may contribute to prognosis, facilitate early interventions and help us understand the nature of ADHD.
