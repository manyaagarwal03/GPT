> **Abstract**

Developmental trajectories of clinically significant ADHD symptoms were
explored in a sample

of 413 children identified as high-risk due to elevated kindergarten
conduct problems. Symptoms

of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity were modeled simultaneously
in a longitudinal latent

class analyses, using parent reports collected in grades 3, 6, 9, and
12. Three developmental

trajectories emerged: 1) low levels of inattention and hyperactivity
(low), 2) initially high but

then declining symptoms (declining), and 3) continuously high symptoms
that featured

hyperactivity in childhood and early adolescence and inattention in
adolescence (high).

Multinomial logistic regressions examined child characteristics and
family risk factors as

predictors of ADHD trajectories. Relative to the low class, children in
the high and declining

classes displayed similar elevations of inattention and hyperactivity in
early childhood. The high

class was distinguished from the declining class by higher rates of
aggression and hyperactivity

at school and emotion dysregulation at home. In contrast, the declining
class displayed more

social isolation at home and school, relative to the low class. Families
of children in both high

and declining trajectory classes experienced elevated life stressors,
and parents of children in the

high class were also more inconsistent in their discipline practices
relative to the low class. By

late adolescence, children in the high class were significantly more
antisocial than those in the

low class, with higher rates of arrests, school dropout, and
unemployment, whereas children in

the declining class did not differ from those in the low trajectory
class. The developmental and

clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

>
> This study supports the notion that clinically significant ADHD

adolescence for some children, but not for others. Children who are more
hyperactive or

aggressive, or whose parents are inconsistent or ineffective with
discipline, are more likely to

have clinically significant and stable ADHD symptoms and show more
antisocial activities and

worse graduation and employment rates in late adolescence. In contrast,
children with clinically

significant ADHD symptoms who are less hyperactive and aggressive, and
who are more

socially isolated, tend to show a declining pattern of ADHD symptoms and
better functional

outcomes.

>
> Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is considered a
> biologically-based but

heterogeneous disorder associated with an array of negative outcomes
(Barkley, 2006). Although

typically conceptualized as chronic, longitudinal research indicates
continuity and discontinuity

in the course of ADHD (Lahey, Pelham, Loney, Lee, & Wilcutt 2005;
Willoughby, 2003). In

general, longitudinal studies suggest that inattention persists, whereas
hyperactivity-impulsivity

(referred to as hyperactivity in the remainder of the paper) declines
with age (Biederman, Mick,

& Faraone, 2000). However, more recent person-oriented analyses suggest
more nuanced

developmental trajectories (Arnold et al., 2014; Larsson, Dilshad,
Lichtenstein, & Barker, 2011).

Adding to prior trajectory research, this study modeled inattention and
hyperactivity

simultaneously in order to better understand the longitudinal
co-variation of clinically-significant

ADHD symptoms across developmental periods (from elementary school
through late

adolescence). The primary goal of this study was to examine conceptually
relevant early child

characteristics and family adversity factors that might differentiate
children in the developmental

trajectories. In addition, late adolescent functioning was explored to
enhance understanding of

the developmental outcomes associated with the trajectories.

**ADHD** **Trajectories**

> A growing body of research highlights important heterogeneity in the
> developmental

course of ADHD. For example, although a majority of children diagnosed
with ADHD show

chronic difficulties, 20% - 50% of children with ADHD no longer meet
diagnostic criteria as

they move through adolescence, suggesting remission, or at least a
marked reduction in symptom

severity for some children (Barkley, 2006; Biederman et al., 1996). In
recent years, person-

oriented analyses have been applied to track the course of ADHD. Studies
modelling parent-

reported ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity combined) from childhood
into mid-adolescence

generally document stability over time, revealing chronically-elevated
ADHD in one (van Lier,

van der Ende, Koot, & Verhulst, 2007) or two classes (Malone, Van Eck,
Flory, & Lamis, 2010).

Interestingly, however, studies modeling teacher-rated inattention alone
reveal more

developmental variability, including high, low, increasing, and
decreasing trajectories (Pingault

et al., 2011; Sasser, Beekman, & Bierman, 2014). Modeling inattention in
the absence of

hyperactivity, however, does not adequately capture ADHD development.
For example, Greven

et al. (2011) found that, despite declines in hyperactivity over time,
childhood hyperactivity

predicted increased adolescent inattention (controlling for early
childhood inattention).

> Two studies have compared trajectories of parent-rated inattention and
> hyperactivity, in

order to better understand symptom co-variation across time. Following a
normative sample

across the ages of 9-17, Larsson et al. (2011) found that many children
in a stable-high

inattention trajectory were also in a declining hyperactivity
trajectory, suggesting a “shift” from

childhood inattention-hyperactivity to adolescent inattention.
Similarly, in children at risk for bi-

polar disorder from ages 6-12, Arnold et al. (2014) found that, in
addition to profiles that were

stable (high or low on inattention and hyperactivity), another profile
demonstrated decreasing

hyperactivity but stable high inattention. These studies suggest that
developmental patterns of

ADHD might be best understood by allowing for co-variation between
inattention and

hyperactivity. In the present study, longitudinal latent class analysis
(LLCA; Collins & Lanza,

2010\) permitted for the simultaneous inclusion of
clinically-significant inattention and

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 6

hyperactivity symptoms in the same longitudinal model, an enhancement
over prior studies that

compared separate symptom trajectories. The major focus of this study
was to examine child and

family risk factors that might differentiate diverging ADHD trajectory
patterns (e.g., chronically

high versus declining).

**Predicting** **ADHD** **Trajectories:** **Child** **Characteristics**
**and** **Family** **Adversity**

> Recognizing the centrality of cognitive and behavioral self-regulation
> deficits, models of

ADHD development suggest that dysfunction in biologically-based
regulatory systems precedes

ADHD and influences its stability (Barkley, 2006; Campbell, Halperin, &
Sonuga-Barke, 2014).

Developmental models also recognize that socialization experiences may
affect the development

of self-regulatory capacities and compensatory skills, thereby altering
the course and outcomes

of ADHD (Campbell et al., 2014). In particular, high-quality
socialization experiences, including

positive adult-child interactions and peer relations, appear to
facilitate the development of child

attention, emotion, and behavior regulation skills (Bernier, Carlson,
Deschenes, & Matte-Gagne,

2012; Bierman & Torres, in press). Conversely, inconsistency,
non-responsiveness, or hostility in

the socializing environment may impair self-regulatory control and
exacerbate child reactivity

and impulsivity (Cicchetti, 2002).

> Interestingly, a recent review of prospective longitudinal studies of
> children with ADHD

identified risk factors that appear particularly salient in predicting
the course of ADHD; among

them were the severity of inattention and hyperactivity, concurrent
aggression, social isolation,

emotional difficulties, and family adversity (Cherkasova, Sulla, Dalena,
Ponde, & Hechtman,

2013). These factors may be linked directly with the course of ADHD to
the extent that they

index dysfunction in biologically-based regulatory systems associated
with ADHD (Barkley,

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 7

2006). In addition, they may affect the developmental course of ADHD
indirectly, by increasing

or decreasing child exposure to the types of predictable and supportive
socialization experiences

associated with the development of self-control capacities (Campbell et
al., 2014). Evidence

supporting the potential influence of each factor is considered briefly
in the following sections.

> **Severity** **of** **inattention** **and** **hyperactivity***.*
> Reflecting the degree of cognitive and

behavioral dysfunction, the severity of inattention and hyperactivity in
childhood predicts ADHD

in adolescence (Cherkasova et al., 2013). More severe inattention
undermines school

performance and effective social interaction, reducing positive support
from teachers and peers

(Campbell et al., 2014). Elevated hyperactivity is associated with
disruptive and rule-breaking

behaviors that increase negative exchanges with parents, teachers, and
peers, thereby further

fueling emotional reactivity and social alienation (Beauchaine et al.,
2010; Campbell et al.,

2014). Among children with ADHD, symptom severity may thus affect the
course of the disorder

by increasing risk for negative socialization experiences and reducing
the positive supports that

foster the continued development of self-regulation skills.

> **Aggression** **and** **social** **isolation.** An extensive database
> suggests that comorbid

aggression increases the stability of childhood ADHD (Hawes, Dadds,
Frost, & Russell, 2013).

In addition, aggression has been linked to stable high or increasing
trajectories of ADHD relative

to low trajectories (Arnold et al., 2014; Sasser et al., 2014; Todd et
al., 2008). In the early school

years, elevated aggression may reflect heightened temperamental
reactivity, serving as a direct

index of biologically-based liabilities (Vitaro, Brendgen, & Tremblay,
2002). In addition,

aggressive behavior greatly increases exposure to coercive exchanges in
which peers and adults

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 8

escalate and reinforce aggressive and impulsive behaviors, undermining
the development of self-

control (Bierman & Sasser, 2014; Vitaro et al., 2002).

> Social isolation is also linked with ADHD, particularly inattention
> (Willcutt et al., 2012),

leading some to suggest that cognitive and temperamental characteristics
(low inhibitory or

effortful control, low social approach) accrue in some children to yield
a pattern of general

disengagement (Milich, Balentine, & Lynam, 2001). Children who are
disengaged cognitively

and socially miss out on key developmental opportunities during the
school years, including

academic instruction and positive interactions with teachers and peers
(Campbell et al., 2014). In

consequence, socially-isolated children with ADHD may be less likely
than socially integrated

children to develop competencies that might mitigate their difficulties
in later years.

> **Emotional** **difficulties**. Characterized behaviorally by
> irritability and emotional

outbursts, emotion dysregulation has received increasing focus as a key
factor in the

development of ADHD (Shaw, Stringaris, Nigg, & Leibenluft, 2014).
Conceptually, by the early

school years, elevated emotion dysregulation reflects high levels of
temperamental reactivity and

negative transactions with caregivers, resulting in difficulty managing
strong feelings and coping

effectively with frustration or disappointment (Beauchaine et al.,
2007). Research suggests that

children with ADHD *and* emotion dysregulation are more likely to
experience social impairment

and more persistent ADHD four years later relative to children with ADHD
only (Biederman et

al., 2012), perhaps as a function of both direct influences and
insufficient socialization.

> Nearly a quarter of the children with ADHD also express emotional
> distress, including

anxiety and depressed mood (Jarrett & Ollendick, 2008). It has been
hypothesized that anxiety or

depression may exacerbate problems associated with ADHD by compounding
cognitive with

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 9

emotional difficulties (e.g., Bubier & Drabick, 2009). That said,
longitudinal studies have

yielded mixed results. Whereas emotional distress (mood or anxiety
disorders) differentiated

boys with persistent ADHD from those with symptom remission in one study
(Biederman et al.,

1996), it did not differentiate ADHD trajectories in another (Arnold et
al., 2014).

> **Family** **adversity.** In addition to child factors, family
> adversity has been implicated in

the course of ADHD (Biederman, Faraone, & Monuteaux, 2002; Counts, Nigg,
Stawicki,

Rappeley, & Von Eye, 2005). For example, high and low ADHD trajectories
are differentiated

by low socio-economic status (SES), large family size, and single-parent
status (Galéra et al.,

2011; Larsson et al., 2011; Sasser et al., 2014). Theoretically,
exposure to family adversity may

maintain or exacerbate ADHD symptoms due to heightened stress and
reduced support that

directly undermine the development and functioning of self-regulatory
systems (Bernier et al.,

2012; Cicchetti, 2002). In addition, family adversity may impair
parenting and increase negative

parent-child interactions. For example, Galéra et al. (2011) found that
coercive parenting

differentiated children in low versus high ADHD trajectory groups, and
Hawes et al. (2013)

linked inconsistent parenting with increased ADHD symptoms one year
later. Together, these

studies suggest that low SES, single-parent status, exposure to
stressful life events, and

ineffective parenting may contribute to chronically high ADHD
trajectories.

> A significant limitation in the earlier literature is a lack of
> studies examining the link

between different developmental patterns of ADHD and later youth
outcomes (Willoughby,

2003; Pingault et al., 2014). In general, ADHD significantly increases
risk for maladjustment in

late adolescence and adulthood, including antisocial activities, school
failure, and unemployment

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 10

(Barkley, 2006). However, only a few studies have validated changes in
ADHD by examining

developmental outcomes. It is possible that children may show declining
patterns of ADHD

without necessarily reducing their risk for negative outcomes. For
example, Pingault et al. (2011)

and Sasser et al. (2014) both found that children with high levels of
inattention at school entry

experienced significant academic difficulties in the later elementary
years, even if their

symptoms declined, perhaps because inattention during the early school
years impeded

acquisition of basic academic skills key for later learning. Links
between ADHD trajectories and

adolescent antisocial activities or adaptation difficulties (high school
dropout, unemployment)

are understudied. The current study added to this important database.

**Present** **Study**

> In summary, the current study had three research aims. First,
> longitudinal patterns of

clinically-significant inattention and hyperactivity were estimated
simultaneously using parent

ratings collected in grades 3, 6, 9, and 12. Consistent with prior
studies that modelled parallel

trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity (Arnold et al., 2014;
Larsson et al., 2011), it was

anticipated that profiles reflecting stable high and low ADHD symptoms
would emerge, as well

as profile(s) that reflected discontinuity in inattention and/or
hyperactivity. Second, child

characteristics (inattention, hyperactivity, aggression, social
isolation, emotion dysregulation,

and emotional distress) and family adversity (low SES, single-parent
status, life stress,

inconsistent parenting) were explored as predictors of ADHD
trajectories. Predictors were

measured in the early school years (kindergarten to grade 2), when
children faced new demands

for self-regulation, social interaction, and learning, thereby providing
an index of functioning in

both home and school contexts (Campbell & Von Stauffenberg, 2008). It
was anticipated that

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 11

elevations in child and family risk factors would be associated with
more chronic ADHD

profiles. Finally, ADHD trajectories were examined in relation to late
adolescent outcomes

(antisocial activities, high-school dropout, unemployment). It was
expected that children with

more chronic profiles of ADHD would experience more impairment in late
adolescence.

> **Method**

**Participants**

> This study included participants of the Fast Track project, a
> multi-site, longitudinal study

of children at risk for conduct problems. Children were recruited from
55 schools serving high-

risk communities located within four sites (Durham, NC; Nashville, TN;
Seattle, WA; and rural

PA). Using a multiple-gating screening procedure, all 9,594
kindergarteners across three cohorts

(1991-93) were screened for classroom conduct problems by teachers
(TOCA-R Authority

Acceptance, Werthamer-Larsson, Kellam & Wheeler, 1991). Children scoring
in the top 40%

within cohort and site were then screened for home behavior problems by
parents, using items

from the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991) and similar scales
(91% of those eligible

participated, n = 3,274). Teacher and parent screening scores were
standardized and summed to

yield a total severity-of-risk screen score, and children were selected
for inclusion into the study

based on this screen score, moving from the highest score downward.
Deviations were made

when a child failed to matriculate in the first grade at a core school
(n=59) or refused to

participate (n=75). The outcome was that 891 high-risk children (n's =
445 for intervention and

446 for control) participated in the Fast Track project. On the
kindergarten Teacher's Report

Form of the Child Behavior Checklist (TRF), which provides national
norms, the average

Externalizing T-score (available for 88% of the sample) was 66.4, and
76% of these children

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 12

scored in the sub-clinical or clinical range (T-scores of 60 or higher).
The sample used in this

study included participants from the high-risk control group (48%
African American, 49%

European American, 3% other; 66% male) who did not receive any
prevention services. At the

first home assessment (end of kindergarten) they were on average 6.5
years (SD = 0.48 years).

> Developmental trajectories of clinically significant ADHD symptoms
> were estimated for

413 children (93% of the high-risk control sample) who had parent
ratings of ADHD from at

least one assessment (grades 3, 6, 9, and 12). During trajectory
estimation using LLCA, missing

data was handled using full information maximum likelihood technique
(FIML) (Lanza, Dziak,

Huang, Wagner, & Collins, 2014). This allowed the inclusion of children
who had parent ratings

at all four time points (50%), three time points (24%), two time points
(11%), or one time point

(8%). The 33 children dropped from the study because they lacked parent
ratings did not differ

significantly from those included on any child or family characteristics
studied here. Missing

data in the outcome variables (ranging from 14-39% of the sample) was
multiply imputed.

**Procedures**

> Parents were interviewed annually at home in the summers by trained
> research staff.

Parents provided informed consent at each time. In the spring of the
early elementary years

(kindergarten, grades 1 and 2), research assistants delivered and
explained measures to teachers,

who completed and returned them to the project. During summer home
visits following grade 12,

youth completed computer-administered interviews in which they listened
to questions via

headphones, and responded directly on the computer. Teachers, parents,
and youth received

financial compensation for study participation. All study procedures
complied with APA ethical

standards and were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
participating universities.

computerized version of the National Institute of Mental Health’s
Diagnostic Interview Schedule

for Children (CDISC; Shaffer & Fisher, 1997), a structured interview
designed to assess

psychiatric disorders and symptoms defined by the *DSM-III-R* (for grade
3; American

Psychological Association \[APA\], 1987) or *DSM-IV* (for grades 6, 9,
and 12; APA, 2000). For

the ADHD diagnosis module, the parent responded “yes” or “no” to
indicate the presence of each

of 9 inattention and 9 hyperactivity symptoms in the prior 6 months (for
grade 3) or prior year

(for grades 6, 9, and 12). To estimate trajectories of clinically
significant ADHD symptoms,

inattention and hyperactivity were each scored dichotomously, with the
presence of 6 or more

symptoms (in grades 3, 6, and 9) or 5 or more symptoms (in grade 12;
APA, 2013) scored “1” to

indicate severity reaching clinically-significant levels or “0” if below
that threshold.

inattention, hyperactivity, aggression, social isolation, and emotional
distress were assessed with

the Child Behavior Checklist-Parent Report Form (CBCL-PRF; Achenbach,
1991) and Child

Behavior Checklist-Teacher Report Form (CBCL-TRF). Scale scores of
inattention,

hyperactivity, and aggression were based on narrow-band scales
previously validated by the Fast

Track project (Stormshak, Bierman, & CPPRG, 1998). Fifteen items
assessed inattention,

including *cannot* *finish* *things*, *cannot* *concentrate*,
*inattentive*, and *does* *not* *finish* *tasks* (average

α = .66 for parents, α = .95 for teachers). Thirteen items assessed
hyperactivity, including

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 14

*hyperactive*, *fidgets*, *disturbs* *others*, *impulsive*, *talks*
*out* *of* *turn* (average α = .75 for parents, α

= .95 for teachers). Nine items assessed aggression, including *gets*
*in* *many* *fights*, *physically*

*attacks* *people*, *threatens*, and *cruel* (average α = .70 for
parents, α = .81 for teachers). Social

isolation was assessed using a 9-item CBCL narrow-band scale, including
*prefers* *to* *be* *alone*,

*shy*, and *withdrawn* (average α = .70 for parents, average α = .81 for
teachers). Emotional

distress was assessed with the anxiety and depression CBCL narrow-band
scale, including 14

items, such as *lonely*, *cries*, *feels* *worthless*, *self-conscious*,
*unhappy*, and *worries* (average α

= .81 for parents, α = .84 for teachers). Each CBCL item was rated on a
3-point scale (0 = *not*

*true*, 1 = *somewhat/sometimes* *true*, 2 = *very/often* *true*). Raw
scores were averaged across the

three years within rater and divided by the number of items in the scale
to represent average item

ratings. Emotion dysregulation was assessed with the Emotion Regulation
subscale of the Social

Competence Scale (CPPRG, 1995), which included 6 items for parents and
10 items for teachers

(e.g., *accepts* *things* *not* *going* *his/her* *way*, *copes* *well*
*with* *failure*, *controls* *temper* *in* *a*

*disagreement,* *appropriately* *expresses* *needs* *and* *feelings*).
Each item was rated on a 5-point

scale (from 0 = *not* *at* *all* to 4 = *very* *well*) (average α = .85
for parents, α = .97 for teachers).

Scores were reversed to reflect emotion dysregulation and averaged
across the three years.

> **Early** **family** **adversity.** In kindergarten to grade 2,
> parents reported on their occupation

and educational level, which were scored using Hollingshead’s (1975)
system to create 5 levels

of SES ranging from 1= *professional/major* *business* to 5 =
*unskilled* *labor/service* *worker*. In

two-parent families, the codes for SES for each parent were averaged
each year, and scores

across the three years were averaged to reflect family SES. Parents
reported on marital status (0

= *married*, 1 = *single* *parent* *-* *separated/divorced,* *widowed,*
*or* *never* *married*).

> During the interviews, parents completed the Life Stress scale of the

Questionnaire (Dodge, Bates, & Pettit, 1990), which included 16 items
describing stressful life

events during the past year (e.g., *medical* *problems* *with* *target*
*child*, *medical* *problems* *with*

*family*, *separation* *of* *target* *child’s* *parents*, *financial*
*problems*, *legal* *problems,* *pregnancies*).

Items represented a selection of common stressors represented on life
event checklists

(Dohrenwend, 2006), and were rated on a 3-point scale (0 = *did* *not*
*occur*, 1 = *minor* *stressor*, 2

= *major* *stressor*). Scores were averaged across the three years
(average α = .61). Parents also

reported on discipline strategies using the Consistent Discipline
subscale of the Parent

Questionnaire (Strayhorn, & Weidman, 1988). Seven items were rated on a
4-point scale (0 =

*never* to 4 = *all* *the* *time*) to describe consistency and
follow-through in limit-setting (e.g., *When*

*you* *give* *your* *child* *a* *command* *or* *order* *to* *do*
*something,* *what* *fraction* *of* *the* *time* *do* *you* *make*

inappropriate and inconsistent

discipline and were averaged across the three years (average α = .71).

> **Late** **adolescent** **outcomes.** At the end of grade 12, parents
> completed the Parent Daily

Report (Chamberlain & Reid, 1987), which included an 8-item assessment
of antisocial behavior

(e.g., *physically* *fight* *with* *anyone*, *tell* *a* *lie*, *take*
*anything* *that* *didn’t* *belong* *to* *him/her*,

*purposely* *destroy* *property*, *scream/yell/or* *shout* *at*
*anyone*, *argue* *or* *talk* *back* *to* *an* *adult*; α

= .73). Youth completed the Self-Reported Delinquency scale (Elliot,
Huizinga, & Ageton,

1985), responding yes/no to describe delinquent behavior during the past
year (e.g., property

damage, theft, assault; α = .87). Juvenile arrest data was collected
from the court system in the

child’s county of residence and surrounding counties through grade 12.
Records included any

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 16

crime for which the individual had been arrested and adjudicated, with
the exception of

probation violations or referrals to youth diversion programs for first
time offenders. Arrests

were categorized into five severity levels, ranging from: (1) status or
traffic offences (e.g.,

curfew violation, runaway, truancy) to (5) violent crimes that involve
serious harm to others

(e.g., aggravated robbery or assault, murder, rape). A “lifetime
severity weighted frequency of

arrests” index was used in the current study reflecting both the number
and severity of offenses

for which an individual had been arrested through grade 12 (Cernkovich &
Giordano, 2001).

> High-school non-completion was recorded if school records did not
> indicate a diploma

within two years after a non-retained student would have completed grade
12, and the youth had

not passed a high school graduation equivalency test (GED). If school
records were missing,

participant and parent interviews were used to assess high school
graduation. Youth reported on

employment status using the *Employment* *Report* *Form* (ERF; Howe &
Frazis, 1992) at two

years after grade 12. Employment status in the present study was
categorized into three levels (0

= *full* *time* *job*, 1 = *part* *time* *job*, 2 = *unemployed*), with
higher scores reflecting unemployment.

> **Results**

**Analysis** **Plan**

> Analyses proceeded in three steps. First, parent ratings of clinically
> significant ADHD

symptoms at grades 3, 6, 9, and 12 were submitted to LLCA, a mixture
model approach for

identifying trajectory classes based on categorical observed indicators
(Collins & Lanza, 2010).

Second, a classify/analyze approach was used to assign children to the
best trajectory class and

multinomial logistic regression analyses examined early elementary child
characteristics and

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 17

family adversity as predictors of trajectory membership. Finally,
ANCOVAs compared the late

adolescent outcomes of children in different trajectories.

**Descriptive** **Statistics**

> Rates of clinically significant levels of hyperactivity were 22.2%
> (grade 3), 10.6% (grade

6), 5.3% (grade 9), and 5.6% (grade 12). Rates of clinically significant
levels of inattention were

19.6% (grade 3), 16.5% (grade 6), 15.8% (grade 9), and 10.7% (grade 12).
Descriptive statistics

for other study variables are shown in Table 1. In early elementary
school, rates of child

difficulties and family adversity were elevated in this high risk
sample. Teachers rated children

as more impaired on each child characteristic than did parents, with the
exception of emotional

distress. In addition, low SES, high rates of single parenthood (more
than half of the sample),

and elevated levels of inconsistent parenting and life stress
characterized the sample.

> Significant sex and demographic (urban African American, urban

several study variables. Boys

received higher scores than girls on inattention, *Fteachers* (1, 445) =

*Fteachers* (1, 444) = 9.81, *Fparents* (1, 445) = 3.96, and were more
likely to live in single-parent

families, *F* (1,435) = 4.57. In late adolescence, boys reported higher
levels of delinquency, *F* (1,

and school dropout, *F* (1,

7.83, high school

noncompletion, *F* (2, 407) = 3.79, and unemployment, *F* (2, 407) =

3.56, and emotional distress, *F* (2, 407) = 2.98 than the other
demographic groups, and urban and

rural European American children experienced elevated levels of life
stress relative to urban

African American children, *F* (2, 407) = 8.69. Sex and demographic
groups were included as

covariates in all subsequent analyses. Correlations among early child
characteristics and family

adversity are shown in Table 2, among late adolescent outcomes in Table
3, and between early

child and family characteristics and emerging adult outcomes in Table 4.

**Longitudinal** **Latent** **Class** **Analyses**

> The first step of the analyses was to characterize developmental
> trajectories, applying

PROC LCA Version 1.3.1 (Lanza et al, 2014) parent reports of inattention
and hyperactivity,

dichotomized at clinically significant thresholds (grades 3, 6, 9, and
12). To select the

appropriate number of trajectory classes, 1000 iterations of each model
were run using randomly

generated starting values. Adequate model fit (indicated by a G2
statistic less than the degrees of

freedom), and lower levels of the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC),
Bayesian Information

Criteria (BIC), and adjusted BIC, along with model interpretability,
were used to identify the

optimal number of classes (Collins & Lanza, 2010). Parameters for LLCA
models including 1-6

trajectory classes are shown in Table 5. Models with two (lowest BIC),
three (lowest adjusted

BIC), and four trajectory classes (lowest AIC) had adequate fit.
However, the difference between

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 19

the AIC’s of the three and four trajectory class solutions was
negligible, and therefore the more

parsimonious three trajectory class model was favored as the final LLCA
model.

> Item-response probabilities are shown in Table 6 and illustrated in
> Figure 1. A low

trajectory class (consistently low levels of inattention and
hyperactivity) included 71% of the

sample, and a declining trajectory (clinically significant inattention
and hyperactivity in 3rd

grade, declining below clinical levels in adolescence) included 16%. A
third trajectory class

(labeled high) included 13% of the sample and was characterized by a
high probability of

clinically significant hyperactivity in grade 3, inattention and
hyperactivity in grade 6, and

inattention in grades 9 and 12. As shown in Table 4, there were no
statistically significant

demographic differences associated with trajectory class membership,
with statistically

equivalent proportions of males and females, urban African American
youth, urban European

American youth, and rural European American youth represented in each
longitudinal profile.

> A classify-analyze approach was used to assign each child to the LLCA
> trajectory class in

which he or she had the highest posterior probability (Lanza et al.,
2014). Average posterior

probabilities were fairly high (0.95, 0.84, and 0.85 for the low,
declining, and high class,

respectively) and the proportions of children assigned to each group
corresponded closely with

the prevalence estimates in the LLCA model, indicating little
classification error.

**as** **Predictors** **of** **ADHD** **Trajectories**

> To identify factors that differentiated the trajectories, multinomial
> logistic regression

models were estimated for each early elementary child characteristic and
family risk. Type III

tests provided an omnibus assessment of the contribution of each risk
factor (controlling for child

sex and site/race); odds ratios (OR) provided pairwise comparisons of
the effect of each risk

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 20

factor for each trajectory versus the others. First, as shown in the
left column of Table 7, relative

to those in the low ADHD trajectory, children in the high trajectory
were more likely to be rated

by teachers and parents as inattentive (ORs = 1.53 and 2.16),
hyperactive (ORs = 3.06 and 3.12),

aggressive (ORs = 2.24 and 1.82), emotionally dysregulated (ORs = 3.44
and 2.51), and

emotional distressed (ORs = 1.53 and 1.52). In fact, only one child
characteristic (social

isolation) did not differentiate the high and low trajectories.
Regarding family adversity, children

in the high ADHD trajectory were also more likely to experience greater
life stress (OR = 1.44)

and more inconsistent parenting (OR = 1.41) than children in the low
trajectory.

> Second, as shown in the middle column of Table 7, relative to children
> in the low ADHD

trajectory, children in the declining trajectory were more likely to be
rated by parents and

teachers as more inattentive (ORs = 1.88 and 2.27), hyperactive (ORs =
1.71 and 2.22),

emotionally dysregulated (ORs = 2.17 and 1.54), and socially isolated
(ORs = 1.32 and 1.37).

Interestingly, only parents (but not teachers) rated children in the
declining trajectory as more

aggressive (OR = 1.50) and emotionally distressed (OR =1.45) than
children in the low

trajectory. Regarding family adversity, children in the declining ADHD
trajectory were more

likely to experience life stress (OR = 1.69) than children in the low
trajectory.

> Third, as presented in the right column of Table 7, relative to
> children in the declining

ADHD trajectory, children in the high trajectory were more likely to be
rated by teachers (but

not parents) as hyperactive (OR = 1.79) and aggressive (OR = 1.90).
Additionally, parents

reported that children in the high trajectory were more emotionally
dysregulated (OR = 1.63).

Results, presented in Table 8,

revealed omnibus differences on each of the outcomes assessed.
Consistent with expectations,

children in the low trajectory demonstrated the best outcomes in late
adolescence. Post hoc

pairwise comparisons revealed that children in the high ADHD trajectory
had significantly

higher levels of antisocial behavior (by parent and self-report),
arrests, and unemployment

compared to children in the low trajectory. Children in the declining
and low trajectories did not

differ on any late adolescent outcomes. Children in the high trajectory
had significantly greater

levels of antisocial behavior (by parent report) and higher rates of
school dropout than children

in the declining group, but the two groups did not differ on
self-reported antisocial behavior or

unemployment, or juvenile arrests.

> **Discussion**
>
> Although ADHD is often considered a chronic disorder, emerging
> longitudinal research

suggests variability in its developmental course. In this study, LLCA
methods identified three

developmental trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity (modelled
simultaneously) in a high-

risk sample of children screened for early conduct problems. Overall,
71% of the sample showed

a low trajectory, with no clinically-significant levels of inattention
or hyperactivity across grades

3 to 12. The other 29% exhibited clinically-significant ADHD symptoms at
one or more points in

time. This rate is higher than the level of parent-reported ADHD
symptoms in normative

populations (around 8.8%, Willcutt, 2012), reflecting the high-risk
status of this sample. Of

these, 16% showed a declining trajectory, with clinically-significant
levels of inattention and

hyperactivity symptoms in grade 3, declining below clinical levels in
late childhood and

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 22

adolescence (grades 6, 9, and 12). The other 13% of the sample fell into
a high trajectory class

characterized by clinical levels of hyperactivity symptoms in grade 3,
inattention and

hyperactivity symptoms in grade 6, and inattention in grades 9 and 12. A
major study goal was

to better understand the early elementary risk factors that predicted
ADHD symptom trajectories,

and which therefore might serve as viable targets for intervention.

**The** **High** **Trajectory** **Class**

> Across studies that have used person-oriented analyses to examine
> trajectories of ADHD

symptoms, many find a profile that is characterized by relatively high,
stable symptom levels,

reflecting ADHD as a chronic disorder. In the current study, with
inattention and hyperactivity

symptoms included in the same LLCA, the high trajectory class was
characterized by clinically

significant levels of hyperactivity during childhood and early
adolescence, which declined below

the clinically-significant threshold in late adolescence. In contrast,
inattention reached clinically-

significant levels in early adolescence and dominated symptom expression
in later adolescence.

These developmental trends are consistent with findings from prior
studies of ADHD symptoms,

with hyperactivity declining somewhat over time and inattention
remaining relatively stable

(Biederman et al., 2000; Willcutt et al., 2012). The pattern found here
is also consistent with the

findings of Larsson et al. (2011), who compared separate models of
inattention and hyperactivity

trajectories and suggested that elevated hyperactivity symptoms in
childhood are associated with

elevated inattention in adolescence. Some researchers have speculated
that hyperactivity

becomes increasingly internalized with age, manifesting as mental
restlessness and distractibility

in adolescence (Greven et al., 2011; Weyandt et al., 2003). It is also
possible that delays in

attention become more pronounced over time as the gap between executive
function skill

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 23

development and increased task demands widens with age (Huizinga, Dolan,
& van der Molan,

2006; Willcutt et al., 2012).

> In this study, children in the high trajectory class were
> distinguished from children

without clinically significant ADHD symptoms on a host of early
childhood characteristics,

including elevated inattention and hyperactivity, aggression, emotion
dysregulation, and

emotional distress. Their parents reported heightened levels of family
stress and difficulties with

inconsistent and ineffective discipline in the early school years.
Children in this high trajectory

class had poorer outcomes, including higher rates of antisocial
behavior, juvenile arrests, and

unemployment than children in the low class, even after controlling for
childhood aggression.

Considered together, these predictors, trajectories, and outcomes are
consistent with negative

cascade models of ADHD, in which initial biologically-based (i.e.,
temperamental, cognitive)

reactivity and dysregulation contribute to impulsive behaviors and
difficulty following rules and

routines, as well as a tendency to respond to limit-setting with
oppositional or aggressive

behavior (Campbell et al., 2014). These early difficulties are
exacerbated by inconsistent and

ineffective parenting and a lack of positive interpersonal support,
which undermine the further

development of self-regulation capacities, contribute to poor school
adjustment and

underachievement, and reinforce antisocial activities (Bierman & Sasser,
2014; Campbell et al.,

2014).

**The** **Declining** **Trajectory** **Class**

> **Declining** **trajectory** **class** **characteristics**. In
> contrast to the high trajectory class,

slightly more than half of the children with elevated ADHD symptoms in
childhood (grade 3)

followed a declining trajectory in which their symptoms fell below
clinical cut-offs for each of

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 24

the subsequent time periods. Previous studies modeling inattention
symptoms alone have also

found declining trajectories (e.g., Pingault et al., 2011; Sasser et
al., 2014). The current study

revealed a trajectory class characterized by declines in both
inattention and hyperactivity.

Relative to children in the low trajectory who never exhibited elevated
ADHD symptoms,

children in the declining trajectory class showed multiple difficulties
during the initial school

years (kindergarten to grade 2), including elevated inattention,
hyperactivity, social isolation, and

emotion dysregulation by both teacher and parent report (relative to the
low group). Their

parents also reported elevated aggression at home, and elevated levels
of life stressors, which

reflect events and experiences that undermined family support, such as
moves, job changes,

interpersonal losses, and medical problems. By late adolescence, not
only were their ADHD

symptoms improved, but these children fared better than those in the
high trajectory class in

areas of parent-reported antisocial outcomes and rates of high school
completion. Although they

were not significantly different from youth in the low ADHD trajectory
on any of the late

adolescent outcomes studied here, they had intermediate scores between
the high and low classes

in areas of self-reported antisocial behavior, arrests, and
unemployment, suggesting some

compromised long-term adjustment.

> **Declining** **vs.** **high** **trajectory** **class**
> **differences**. Direct comparisons of the early

childhood characteristics of youth who followed a chronic high versus
declining trajectory

revealed three significant differences. Those who followed a high
trajectory pattern were more

aggressive and more hyperactive at school (based on teacher report) and
more emotionally

dysregulated at home (based on parent report) than were children who
showed declining

symptoms. In addition, although these two groups did not differ
significantly on other variables,

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 25

only the declining class showed elevated social isolation at home and
school (relative to the low

group), whereas only the high class exhibited elevated emotional
distress at school and

inconsistent parenting at home (relative to the low group).

> These differences are relatively small, and they do not provide
> definitive information

regarding the mechanisms that account for the different developmental
pathways experienced by

children in the two classes. However, several possibilities exist, which
might be explored more

fully in future research. First, exposure to stressful life events in
early elementary was associated

with both high and declining patterns of ADHD, which is consistent with
some prior studies that

suggest that early family adversity contributes to delays in
self-regulatory skill development and

thereby may amplify inattentive and hyperactive behavior in early
childhood (Bernier et al.,

2012; Cicchetti, 2002; Sasser et al., 2014). Theorists have suggested
that family adversity might

directly increase levels of child emotional distress in ways that
distract or over-burden regulatory

processing and impede executive function maturation in early childhood
(Blair & Raver, 2012).

In addition, exposure to family life stressors may increase
unpredictability and disorganization at

home, reducing parental attention, and thereby undermining effective
scaffolding of early child

self-regulatory development (Sasser et al., 2014).

> It is also possible that elevated life stress and biological
> vulnerabilities contributed to the

early ADHD symptoms of children in both the high and declining
trajectory classes, but that

children in the declining class were more able to benefit from
socialization experiences at home

and school and thereby showed developmental “catch up” in the later
school years. In contrast,

children in the high trajectory class, who also experienced inconsistent
parenting in addition to

elevated life stress, showed more emotional distress at home and more
behavioral dysfunction at

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 26

school, including higher levels of hyperactivity and aggression. The
generalization and

escalation of hyperactive and aggressive behavior in the school setting
may indicate that children

with chronic ADHD had greater biological vulnerability and were more
impulsive and risk-

taking than those in the declining trajectory class; it is also possible
that their exposure to

inconsistent and ineffective parental discipline in the early years
amplified their impulsive and

aggressive tendencies (Campbell et al., 2014). These children may have
been less amenable to

positive socialization efforts at school, and more likely to become
enmeshed in coercive

interactions with teachers and peers that further undermined
self-regulatory skill development,

particularly at the transition into adolescence when they gained more
autonomy (Beauchaine et

al., 2010; Bierman & Sasser, 2014; Cernkovich & Giordano, 2001).

> Although social isolation is generally considered a risk factor, it is
> possible that children

in the declining ADHD class, who were more socially withdrawn than
children in the low

trajectory class, elicited more positive support from teachers and peers
than the more socially

prominent and disruptive children in the high trajectory class.
Considering the poorer late

adolescent outcomes of children in the high trajectory, it may be that
social isolation also

protected children in the declining class from deviant peer influences
at the transition into

adolescence (Loeber et al., 1993). Future research is needed to explore
these or other potential

mechanisms associated with declining versus chronic high patterns of
ADHD symptoms.

Understanding these mechanisms enhances developmental models of the
disorder, and may

inform areas to target with early intervention.

**Limitations**

> Developmental Trajectories of ADHD 27
>
> A major strength and unique feature of this study was the availability
> of repeated parent

ratings of ADHD symptoms, which allowed for trajectories that modeled
inattention and

hyperactivity simultaneously and covered a time period longer than prior
studies, from grade 3 to

grade 12. Additional unique features included data on early child
characteristics and family risks

that were assessed prior to the trajectories, and a set of important
outcomes measured in late

adolescence to validate trajectories of clinically significant ADHD
symptoms.

> At the same time, the study had several limitations. First, the
> trajectories were based on

parent ratings and used dichotomous indicators of clinically-significant
symptom levels. The

availability of repeated parent ratings over time facilitated the
modeling of trajectories, but

parent ratings are also subject to biases. It is unclear how many of the
children rated as having

elevated ADHD symptoms in grade 3 would have been diagnosed with ADHD
had a more

comprehensive diagnostic evaluation been completed. Parents reported
that 22% of the children

in the declining trajectory had received “medication to control behavior
or attention” by the end

of grade 2 (age 8), whereas 52% of the children in the high trajectory
had received medication

(compared with just 7% in the low trajectory). This suggests that a
relatively greater proportion

of the children in the high trajectory received medication evaluations
associated with their

ADHD symptoms (or other behavior problems). The quality of the
medication evaluations was

likely variable, but it is possible that more of the children in the
high group than in the declining

group would have qualified for a full diagnosis of ADHD had more
complete assessments been

employed in the current study.

kindergarten entry. Hence, the study provides rich information regarding
the diverging

development and outcomes of a subset of children with ADHD symptoms,
specifically those

with early aggressive and oppositional behaviors. The results may not
adequately characterize

the development of children with ADHD symptoms who do not show
concurrent early conduct

problem behavior. In addition, this study focused on risk factors
typically associated with

conduct problems; future research should also explore temperament and
cognitive factors that

might also differentiate developmental trajectories. For instance, it is
possible that executive

function skill development may predict diverging
inattention/hyperactivity trajectories.

amount and kind of treatment experienced by children may have influenced
their developmental

trajectories. By the end of grade 2, many of the parents in the sample
reported that their children

had received some kind of “treatment for emotional or behavioral
difficulties” at school or at

home (25% of the children in the low group, 49% of the children in the
declining group, 80% of

the children in the high group). This high rate of service use reflects
the high-risk nature of the

sample, which was selected for elevated conduct problems. However, the
nature and quality of

services across these high-risk settings was likely highly variable. The
study findings represent

developmental trajectories and outcomes that occur given “treatment as
usual” in economically-

disadvantaged communities in four diverse geographical regions of the
U.S.

variations in samples, modeling strategies, and measurement that affect
the trajectories

identified. In this study, inattention and hyperactivity were modeled
simultaneously and

clinically significant cut-offs were used to better understand
developmental variation in

disordered levels of ADHD symptoms. In contrast, other studies have
modeled symptom

severity, which may provide additional information to inform trajectory
patterns.

> The findings suggest that a developmental perspective may be critical

the clinical course of ADHD. Variable-centered analyses tend to
emphasize linear associations

across time. In contrast, the person-oriented trajectory model used in
this study reveals important

non-linear associations characterizing different developmental profiles
of clinically significant

ADHD symptoms that may inform clinical assessment and treatment. For
example, although

hyperactivity symptoms decline over time, the trajectories that emerged
in this sample suggest

that hyperactivity in childhood may be salient in predicting chronicity,
particularly when

hyperactivity is observed across the home and school settings, and also
when it is accompanied

by aggressive behavior. In addition, given their association with
differential developmental

trajectories in this study, emotional difficulties, including emotion
dysregulation and emotional

distress, may need more attention in ADHD treatment models that tend to
focus primarily on

behavioral and cognitive impairments (see Shaw et al., 2014).
Recognizing that many children

with childhood ADHD improve over time, an important, unanswered question
for future research

is whether preventive interventions during the early school years
designed to target key

developmental factors might successfully divert more children with ADHD
from the stable high

to a declining trajectory class, with corresponding long-term benefits
(see Chacko et al., 2009).

Future research of this kind is needed to help to fill in the gaps in
the existing literature, and

illuminate the developmental mechanisms that may underlie diverse
developmental trajectories

of ADHD symptoms. In turn, a better understanding of the developmental
course and processes

associated with ADHD trajectories may inform more effective prevention
and intervention

approaches.
