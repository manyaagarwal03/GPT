### **Abstract**
**Objective:** This study examined trajectories of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom levels across one preschool year and explored variation in trajectories by age, sex, and end-of-year impairment. **Method:** Participants were 261 preschoolers (87% Head Start; 59% Caucasian; 53% boys; Mage = 3.97 years). Teachers rated ADHD symptom levels four times throughout one academic year. **Results:** Results showed a course of increasing inattention that decelerated over time and steadily increasing hyperactivity/impulsivity. Group-based finite mixture modeling revealed three trajectories of inattention: stable low (57%), change (32%), and stable high (11%), as well as three trajectories of hyperactivity/ impulsivity: stable low (63%), increasing (26%), and stable high (11%). Compared to children with increasing or changing symptoms levels, children with stable high levels were more impaired and children with stable low symptom levels were less impaired. **Conclusion:** Findings suggest a “wait and see” approach to treatment may miss an important opportunity for early intervention.

With widespread consensus among the research and clinical communities regarding the chronic and impairing nature of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), there has been an increased interest in the early identification of ADHD in preschool-aged children to improve the feasibility of early and preventative treatment approaches (e.g., Halperin & Marks, 2019; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2011). Yet, due to the rapid developmental changes occurring during early childhood, it is critical that identification efforts are able to differentiate developmentally abnormal elevations of ADHD symptoms from more typical, time-limited, problem behaviors. This differentiation is particularly important for ADHD, since developmentally normative hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity are all to be expected at the preschool age. Indeed, the developmental changes occurring during early childhood may limit the usefulness of cross-sectional data to inform understanding of young children’s attention and behavior, pointing to the clear need for longitudinal research designs (Leblanc et al., 2008). To date, longitudinal studies of the developmental course of ADHD have focused almost exclusively on parent reports, and there are only a handful of studies that examine children at multiple time points in preschool (Galéra et al., 2011; Harvey et al., 2015; Leblanc et al., 2008; Romano et al., 2006; Shaw et al., 2005; Tandon et al., 2011; Willoughby et al., 2012); this leaves a gap in our understanding of how ADHD symptoms may fluctuate within the preschool years, particularly from the perspective of teachers. To address this gap, the current study examined the developmental course of teacher-rated ADHD symptoms in a community sample across one academic preschool year.

# **Longitudinal Investigations of Preschool ADHD**
Existing longitudinal research has examined both the devel- opmental course of ADHD symptoms that begin in pre- school, as well as the developmental outcomes associated with early-emerging symptoms. This work highlights that both children with elevated behavior problems and those meeting full diagnostic criteria for ADHD in preschool fre- quently continue to evidence symptoms and impairment (e.g., academic and social impairment, comorbid mental health problems) later in childhood, both at home and school. Additionally, research examining diagnostic reten- tion rates over time has helped to establish the relative stabil- ity of overall ADHD diagnoses made during preschool , as well as the relative *instability* of ADHD presentations across time. Taken together, this work underscores that parents, teachers, and clinicians should pay close attention to ADHD symptoms in early childhood and should consider how best to intervene to prevent the onset of later functional impairment.

In order to develop a strong system of early identifica- tion and intervention, a nuanced understanding of how the full range of early emerging symptoms change and persist over time is needed. To accomplish this goal, a number of studies have used dimensional measures of ADHD to explore the average trajectories of early emerging ADHD symptoms over time as well as group-based patterns of change. Given the many methodological differences across studies (e.g., different symptom mea- sures or assessment time frames), it can be difficult to draw clear conclusions about the developmental course of symp- toms that begin in preschool. Nonetheless, findings from existing longitudinal work assessing symptoms of ADHD among preschoolers generally suggest stable or declining hyperactivity/impulsivity and increasing inattention across early childhood. Yet, the emergence of statistically derived groupings of children with distinct pathways of change in symptoms over time highlights substantial individual variability in symptom trajectories. Not all children with elevated ADHD symptoms in preschool show a course of decreasing hyper- activity/impulsivity and increasing inattention.

Importantly, nearly all extant longitudinal work examin- ing the developmental course of ADHD symptoms has relied exclusively on parent reports. One exception comes from the work of Sasser et al. (2015) who examined teacher ratings of the nine DSM-based symptoms of inattention among children previously enrolled in Head Start across four annual assessments from kindergarten to third grade. Results yielded four unique developmental trajectories of inattention: stable low, stable high, increasing, and decreas- ing. Although results do not provide information on the tra- jectories of inattention during preschool, results support the presence of symptom trajectory heterogeneity from the teacher perspective.

# **Why the Teacher Perspective?**
Despite the important work by Sasser et al. (2015), it remains unclear how symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/ impulsivity progress during early childhood from the per- spective of teachers. This gap in the literature is noteworthy given that ADHD diagnoses require the presence of symp- toms in multiple settings, and thus, the teacher perspective is often a critical component to assessment and diagnosis. Furthermore, schools and child care centers serve an impor- tant role in conducting developmental screenings and pro- viding referrals for further assessment and intervention services. In addition, more than half of U.S. children ages 3 to 6 spend at least some time in early care or education set- tings before entry into kindergarten. Thus, it is essential that this area of research begin to include the per- spectives of early childhood educators. Moreover, because current research varies in the measures used to assess ADHD symptoms, with many utilizing 3 to 5 item scales, more research is needed using all 18 DSM-based symptoms of ADHD to allow for distinct examination of the hyperactive/ impulsive and inattentive dimensions.

# **Current Study Aims and Hypotheses**
Because preschool is a time of rapid development, when many forms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are developmentally normative, it is necessary to gain a bet- ter understanding of the course of ADHD *within* the pre- school years, particularly from the perspective of early educators. Accordingly, the current study examined the continuities and discontinuities in teacher-rated ADHD symptoms measured at four time points during one pre- school year. The first aim of this study was to investigate a variable-centered approach to examine average change in symptoms of both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity across the year. Based on longitudinal research document- ing an overall trajectory of increasing inattention and decreasing or stable hyperactivity/impulsivity during early childhood, we hypothesized a slight increase in inattention and a slight decrease in hyperactivity/impulsivity symptom levels across the four study time points.

The second aim of this study was to conduct an explor- atory person-centered analysis to investigate if there are meaningful groups with different school-year trajectories of inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Although this aspect of the current study was exploratory due to the mini- mal amount of relevant literature, we hypothesized the emergence of at least three groups of symptom level change per outcome domain (i.e., inattention, hyperactivity/impul- sivity), including a persistent high group, persistent low group, and a change group (increasing inattention, decreas- ing hyperactivity/impulsivity). These tentative hypotheses were based on person-centered work by Shaw et al. (2005) and Willoughby et al. (2012) who reported the presence of both stable and changing groups in their samples using a combined measure of inattention and hyperactivity/impul- sivity. These hypotheses were also informed by the broader longitudinal literature showing different patterns of change in symptom levels when examining inattention and hyper- activity/impulsivity separately.

Taking into consideration the sex differences commonly reported in ADHD symptom prevalence, in addition to the many developmental changes occurring between ages 3 and 5, the models included in this study also examined how age and sex are related to the developmental trajectories that emerged. Finally, differ- ences in end-of-year impairment across ADHD trajectory groups were examined to determine if functional conse- quences are associated with different patterns of ADHD symptomatology across the year.

# **Method**
## *Participants and Procedures*
The current study is in compliance with the University of Vermont’s (UVM) Institutional Review Board. Participants were 261 preschool students (*M*age = 3.97, *SD*age = 0.61; 53% male) drawn from 18 Head Start-affiliated early education classrooms associated with the same local Head Start grantee program during the 2018 to 2019 school year. Children from eight classrooms (*n* = 113) participated in a larger study con- ducted by researchers at UVM, herein referred to as “sub- sample A.” All participants drawn from the UVM study had documented parental consent. Data for the remaining ten classrooms (*n* = 148) were drawn from a child information database collected and managed by the Head Start program and were shared in a deidentified format (herein referred to as “subsample B”). Of the 261 participants, 87% were enrolled in Head Start highlighting that the majority of chil- dren came from families experiencing various forms of socioeconomic disadvantage (e.g., living below the federal poverty threshold, experiencing homelessness). The sample was racially and ethnically diverse (59% White, 18% Black, 12% Asian, 1% Pacific Islander, 8% other including multira- cial/biracial and American Indian, and 2% unspecified). There were no exclusion criteria for the study.

Teachers from all 18 classrooms completed measures of attention, behavior, and impairment for participating chil- dren at four time points over the course of an academic year. Measures were administered to teachers in late September (Time 1/Baseline), early December (Time 2), late January (Time 3), and early May (Time 4). The current study uses a subset of variables from the collected teacher ratings.

## *Measures*
*Demographic information.* Demographic information, includ- ing child sex, race/ethnicity, and birth date was collected from each child’s school record.

*ADHD symptoms.* Teachers rated symptoms of ADHD with the 18-item ADHD Rating Scale—IV Preschool Version on a 4-point Likert scale indicating the frequency of each DSM-IV ADHD symptom (0 = not at all; 3 = very often). Notably, the 18 designated ADHD symptoms did not change from the DSM-IV to the DSM-V. Items were averaged across the inattention (IA) and hyper- activity/impulsivity (HI) subscales and demonstrated good reliability (i.e., 0.93 to 0.95 for IA assessments; 0.92 to 0.93 for HI assessments).

*End-of-year impairment.* Teachers rated impairment at Time 4 using the Children’s Problem Checklist, a six-item measure of ADHD-related impairments in a preschool setting. Teachers were instructed to rate if each item was a problem, and if yes, indicate problem severity (mild, moderate, or severe). Impairment areas included gen- eral disruptiveness, difficulty with peer and adult relation- ships, self-esteem, and accidents (e.g., falls, spills). Responses were scored on a four-point scale (0 = no impair- ment, 3 = severe impairment), summed to provide an overall indicator of impairment in the school setting, and demon- strated good reliability (a = .80).

## *Data Analytic Plan*
All modeling procedures were conducted using Mplus ver- sion 8. First, average trajectories of IA and HI were estimated using unconditional and condi- tional Latent Growth Curve Models (LGCMs). Covariates included age and sex. Subsample was also included as a covariate to control UVM-directed program participation by subsample A. Following the procedures outlined in Wickrama et al. (2016), models were compared using Akaike’s Information Criteria (AIC), Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), standardized root mean residual (SRMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). Best fit is indicated by the smallest AIC and BIC values, SRMR values less than or equal to 0.08, RMSEA values less than or equal to 0.06, and CFI and TLI values of 0.95 or greater.

Second, finite mixture modeling analyses were con- ducted to explore latent groupings with distinct trajectories of change. A series of models were fit to the data, with num- ber of classes per model added iteratively. All estimated models were compared using AIC, BIC, adjusted BIC (aBIC), entropy, and the Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT). Higher entropy values indicate improved enumeration accuracy and class separation. The LMR-LRT compares the indicated model to a model with one fewer classes to determine the best-fitting model (Wickrama et al., 2016). Each model was also evaluated on its conceptual interpretability and parsimony. Follow-up analyses using SPSS (Version 26) examined differences in latent class groups based on age, sex, and Time 4 impairment.

# **Results**
## *Preliminary Analyses*
Sample descriptives and correlations among study variables are presented in Table 1. Approximately 66% of participants had complete ADHD symptom level data. As almost 17% of the sample was missing one time point of data, 8% was missing two time points of data, and 9% was missing three time points of data, procedures outlined in Graham (2009) were utilized to address missing data. Specifically, in order to reduce bias in parameter estimates and standard errors that stem from missing ADHD symptom level data, all mod- els for aims one and two were examined using maximum likelihood estimation (ML). No sex and age data were miss- ing and 18% of Time 4 impairment data were missing. To address impairment data missingness, multiple imputation was used for all models examining Time 4 impairment.

## *Unconditional Latent Growth Curve Models*
Symptom means and standard errors across time are reported in Table 2. A series of unconditional LGCMs with varying structures of polynomial change (i.e., linear, qua- dratic) were fit to the data for IA and HI symptomatology. For IA symptom levels, the quadratic model demonstrated a better fit to the data across all model fit indices. Compared to the linear model, the quadratic model had lower AIC (linear = 1351.54; quadratic = 1337.32), BIC (linear = 1383.62; quadratic = 1380.09), aBIC (linear = 1355.09; quadratic = 1342.05), RMSEA (linear = 0.11; quadratic = 0.0), and SRMR (linear = 0.04; quadratic = 0.02) values and

higher TLI (linear = 0.97; quadratic = 1.0), and CFI (lin- ear = 0.98; quadratic = 1.0) values. For HI symptoms, the quadratic model   revealed   slightly   lower   AIC   (lin- ear = 1251.06; quadratic = 1238.01), BIC (linear = 1283.14; quadratic = 1280.78), and aBIC (linear = 1254.61; qua- dratic = 1242.73) values, a lower RMSEA (linear = 0.12; quadratic = 0.07), and a slightly higher TLI (linear = 0.97; quadratic = 0.99) value compared to the linear model. Both the CFI (linear and quadratic = 0.98) and SRMR (linear and quadratic = 0.03) values were equal across the linear and quadratic models. Although the quadratic model was slightly favored based on model fit indices, model results indicated no significant quadratic parameter. Given there were no differences in effects along with a preference for parsimony, the linear model was selected to represent change in HI symptom levels. The final models revealed an average increase in IA symptom levels with a deceleration in the rate of change in IA symptom levels (intercept effect = 0.065, *p* < .001; linear effect = 0.05, *p* < .001; qua- dratic effect = −0.004, *p* = .01). Further, results indicated an average increase in HI symptom   levels   (intercept effect = 0.066, *p* < .001; linear effect = 0.02, *p* < .001).

## *Conditional Latent Growth Curve Models*
Covariates were added to the best-fitting IA and HI models from above. For both IA and HI conditional models, model fit was deemed adequate (IA: AIC = 1301.29, BIC = 1376.13, aBIC = 1309.55, RMSEA= 0.02, CFI = 1.0, TLI = 0.99, SRMR = 0.01; HI: AIC = 1229.94, BIC = 1283.41, aBIC = 1235.85, RMSEA= 0.08, CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.96, SRMR

= 0.03). In the context of the model, results revealed a sig- nificant difference between subsample A and B in the inter- cept of the IA model such that children from subsample B began the year with higher IA symptom levels than children from subsample A (intercept effect for subsample = 0.24, *p* = .007). However, there was no subsample effect on the rate of change in IA symptom levels.

IA symptom level means across the year by sex are reported in Table 2. Results revealed a significant unique intercept effect for sex, such that boys began the year with higher IA symptom levels than girls (intercept effect for sex = −0.25, *p* = .005). There was also a significant sex dif- ference in the linear slope factor, indicating that boys dem- onstrated a larger rate of increase in IA symptom levels over the year as compared to girls (slope effect for sex = −0.06, *p* = .025). There was no sex effect for the quadratic term, suggesting that the rate of deceleration in IA symptom lev- els across time did not differ between boys and girls. For age, results showed a unique effect for intercept, indicating that being younger was linked with higher IA symptom lev- els at the beginning of the year (intercept effect for age = −0.28, *p* < .001), though the pattern of change in IA symptom levels over time did not vary by age.

Results for HI symptom levels indicated that when con- trolling for children’s age and sex, subsample B began the year with higher HI symptom levels than subsample A (inter- cept effect for subsample = 0.27, *p* = .002), but did not differ from subsample A in their rate of change in HI symptom lev- els. Further, when controlling for children’s age and subsam- ple, boys began the year with higher HI symptom levels than girls (intercept effect for sex = −0.27, *p* = .002) and had a mar- ginally significant larger rate of increase in HI symptom lev- els (slope effect for sex = −0.02 *p* = .066; see Table 2 for HI symptom level means by sex). In the context of the HI model, age was not associated with baseline HI symptom levels. However, being older was linked with a steeper increase in symptom levels (slope effect for age = 0.02, *p* = .026).

## *Finite Mixture Modeling*
*Model selection.* Using the best-fitting model structure from the unconditional LGCM, a series of Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) models were fit to the data, with number of classes per model added iteratively. Based on model fit indi-

ces along with a preference for parsimony, the three- class quadratic solution was selected as the best-fitting IA LCGA model (AIC = 1317.72; BIC = 1371.19; Entropy = 0.89;

Adjusted LMR-LRT = 201.60, *p* = .02). For HI symptomatol- ogy, model fit indices and the parsimony of the three-class model over the 4-class model led to the selection of the three- class linear LCGA as the best-fitting model (AIC = 1233.14; BIC = 1275.92; Entropy = 0.91; Adjusted LMR-LRT = 203.91,

*p* > .05). A series of Growth Mixture Models (GMMs), which allow all within-class parameters to vary, were attempted in both the IA and HI domains. However, due to model com- plexity there were a number of model specification errors that could not be resolved. As such, LCGA models with restricted within-class intercept and slope parameters were selected as the final models in both symptom domains.

*Model results.* Final model results are presented in Table 3. For the 3-class IA model, Class 1 (11% of sample) was assigned the descriptive label “IA Stable High” given that this group began the year with high symptom levels (base- line intercept = 2.03, *p* < .001) that remained stable over time (i.e., nonsignificant linear and quadratic terms). Class 2 (32% of sample) was given the descriptive label “IA Change” given that this group began the year with moderate symptom levels (baseline intercept = 0.97, *p* < .001) and showed a pattern of increasing symptom levels that deceler- ated over time (linear slope = 0.08, *p* = .02; quadratic term = −0.008, *p* = .04). Finally, Class 3 (57% of sample) was given the descriptive label “IA Stable Low” given that this group began the year with low IA symptom levels (baseline intercept = 0.21, *p* < .001), that remained stable over time (i.e., nonsignificant linear and quadratic terms).

For the three-class HI symptom model, Class 1 (11% of sample) began the year with high HI symptom levels (base- line intercept = 2.15, *p* < .001), which remained stable across the year (i.e., nonsignificant linear slope). This class was therefore given the descriptive label “HI Stable High.” Class 2 (26% of sample) was given the descriptive label “HI Increasing” given that this group began the year with mod- erate HI symptom levels (baseline intercept = 0.91, *p* < .001)

Finally, Class 3 (63% of sample) was given the descriptive label “HI Stable Low” given that this group started the year with relatively low symptom lev- els (baseline intercept = 0.26, *p* < .001) and symptom levels did not change across the year (i.e., nonsignificant linear slope). Latent class group means for IA and HI at each of the four study time points are reported in Table 4.

## *Follow-Up Analyses*
*Variation in latent class group membership by impair- ment.* Using the final latent class groups reported above, group membership variation by Time 4 impairment was examined (see Table 5 for impairment means across latent class groups). Multiple regression models were examined using dummy-coded group membership variables as predic- tors of impairment. Two dummy-coded variables were entered in each model where the IA Change or HI Increas- ing groups served as the reference categories that were compared to the Stable High and Stable Low groups in the respective models. For IA, results suggest a stepwise pat- tern such that impairment for the IA Change group was

significantly lower than the IA Stable High group (*b* = 1.81, *p* = .01) and significantly higher than the IA Stable Low group (*b* = −0.87, *p* < .001). Similarly, impairment in the HI Increasing group was significantly lower than HI Stable High group (*b* = 2.20, *p* = .003) and significantly higher than the HI Stable Low group (*b* = −0.92, *p* < .001).

*Variation in latent class group membership by age.* Means and standard deviations for children’s ages by latent class groups are reported in Table 5. For the IA symptom domain, results from the one-way ANOVA were significant, indicating there was mean-level variability in children’s ages across IA latent class groups, *F* (2, 258) = 3.27, *p* = .04. Follow-up pairwise comparisons revealed that children in the IA Stable High group were significantly younger than children in the IA Stable Low group (*p* = .03, Cohen’s *d* = 1.10). Neither the IA Stable High nor the IA Stable Low groups differed signifi- cantly from the IA Change group. In the HI symptom domain, age did not vary across latent class groups.

*Variation in latent class group membership by sex.* A series of binary logistic regressions were conducted to examine vari- ation in latent class groups based on sex (see Table 6 for results). For IA symptomatology, membership in the IA Stable Low group was significantly associated with child sex when compared to membership in the IA Change group, *b* = 0.814, Wald c2(1) = 8.31, *p* = .004. Children in the IA Stable Low group were 2.26 times as likely to be female than children in the IA Change group. Moreover, member- ship in the in the IA Stable High group was significantly associated with child sex when compared to the IA Stable Low group, *b* = −0.938, Wald c2(1) = 4.95, *p* = .026. Chil- dren in the IA Stable High group were 2.56 times as likely to be male than children in the IA Stable Low group (odds ratio for males = the inverse of odds ratio for females: 1.0/0.39 = 2.56). The ratio of boys to girls did not vary between the IA Stable High and IA Change groups.

For HI symptomatology, membership in the HI Stable Low group was significantly associated with child sex when compared to membership in the HI Increasing group, *b* = 0.863, Wald c2(1) = 8.39, *p* = .004. Specifically, children in the HI Stable Low group were 2.37 times as likely to be female than children in the HI Increasing group. Moreover, membership in the HI Stable High group was significantly associated with child sex when compared to the HI Stable

Low group, *b* = −1.20, Wald c2(1) = 7.28, *p* = .007. Specifically, there was a 3.33 times greater likelihood of being male in the HI Stable High group as compared to the HI Stable Low group (odds ratio for males = the inverse of odds ratio for females: 1.0/0.30 = 3.33). The ratio of boys to girls did not vary between the HI Stable High and Increasing groups.

# **Discussion**
The primary goal of this study was to build on existing research to better understand the course of preschoolers’ ADHD symptom trajectories within an academic year from the perspective of early childhood educators, and to con- sider a full range of IA and HI symptomatology (i.e., all 18 ADHD symptoms). Results demonstrated, on average, a course of increasing inattention that decelerated over time and a course of steadily increasing hyperactivity/impulsiv- ity across the year. Within symptom domains, the vast majority of children demonstrated low IA and HI symptom levels that remained stable across the year, while a small minority of children followed a chronic pattern of symptom elevations that remained stable across the year. About a third of children demonstrated moderate IA symptom levels that changed slightly (increased with deceleration) while about a quarter of children followed an increasing course of HI symptom levels during the year. Importantly, in both domains, children with stable high symptom levels were more impaired than children with increasing or changing levels, who in turn were more impaired than children with stable low symptom levels.

These findings stand in contrast to prior research and the study’s a priori hypotheses, which posited a pattern of increasing IA and decreasing or stable HI symptoms. Importantly, there are methodological differences between the present study and past research, which may account for the divergence from prior findings. Specifically, this study purposely sought to address the gap in our understanding of ADHD symptom trajectories within preschool using the teacher perspective. Given the well-documented discor- dance between parent and teacher ratings in school- and preschool-aged populations, dif- ferences between parent- and teacher-rated symptom trajec- tories are, perhaps, not surprising. Additionally, with very few studies including more than one assessment of symp- toms during preschool, and none, to our knowledge, focused entirely on one academic year, the results of this study are difficult to compare to research that explores symptoms over longer spans of time.

The discussion of ADHD symptom level trajectories would be incomplete without highlighting the makeup of our sample. Specifically, this study drew from a predomi- nantly low-income community population and therefore findings are not generalizable to a clinical sample of chil- dren diagnosed with ADHD. Across both subsamples A and B, mean ADHD symptoms for both IA and HI were rela- tively low and far below what would be considered the clinical range. However, it is noteworthy that even in a community sample, there was significant variability in scores. Thus, although the results of this study cannot speak to the symptom trajectories of children diagnosed with ADHD, findings do shed light on the trajectory of inatten- tion and hyperactivity/impulsivity in a predominantly nor- mative, but low-income sample.

## *Key Differences Across Boys and Girls*
In addition to understanding the average trajectories and continuities/discontinuities in symptom change across time, we sought to examine the relation of children’s sex to the developmental course of symptoms through the year. Across both symptom domains, boys started the preschool year with higher levels of symptoms than girls and increased in their symptom levels at a faster rate. Of note, the difference in rates of HI symptom increases between boys and girls was only marginally significant, and therefore warrants replication. Moreover, children with the least risk for ADHD (i.e., the HI and IA Stable Low groups) were more likely to be female than the groups that displayed any change (i.e., IA Change/HI Increasing) or the stable high groups (i.e., IA Stable High/HI Stable High), suggesting males may be more likely than females to have either an increasing or stable high course of symptomatology through the year. These results are consistent with research docu- menting an association between being male and high/per- sistent IA and HI using parent-reported symptoms , as well as the broader literature showing a higher preschool ADHD diagnostic rate among boys as compared to girls . Although this study supports the finding that boys are at a greater risk for elevated ADHD symptom levels and persis- tence of symptoms over time compared to girls, other work has shown that when comparing girls with ADHD to typi- cally developing girls, the magnitude of the difference in symptom severity is *larger* than when comparing boys with ADHD to typically developing boys . Further, some research suggests girls with ADHD may be at greater risk than boys for negative developmental outcomes. Hence, future research should continue to focus on sex differences in symptom onset, symptom progression, and related impairment outcomes to aid in our understanding of how to best identify and treat ADHD in both boys and girls.

## *Age Differences During Early Childhood*
This study was unique in its ability to examine the effect of age on symptom trajectories given that most studies on this topic have had more restricted age ranges at each assess- ment time point. Past research has shown that older preschoolers are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for ADHD than younger preschoolers but the ability to predict ADHD diagnosis in kindergarten from preschool behavior problems does not differ for preschool ratings collected at ages 3, 4, or 5. In this sample, being younger was associated with higher lev- els of IA at the start of the year and following a course of stable high IA symptoms, whereas being older was associ- ated with steeper increases in HI over the year.

Findings from the present study raise two important questions. First, is being younger a risk factor for elevated IA symptom levels or simply reflective of a normative dif- ference between older and younger children in their innate attentional capacities? As many classrooms in this study included children ranging in age from three to five, it is pos- sible that age-typical inattention of younger children stood out in contrast to their older peers, an effect that may not happen in a classroom with only one age group. Second, how might variations in teacher expectations for behavior across older and younger children influence symptom rat- ings? It is possible that being older was associated with a steeper increase in HI symptoms because teachers increased their expectations for behavior for the older children in the class as they approached entry to kindergarten. Further con- sideration of how symptom onset and progression differ across children at different ages in preschool is needed and should be prioritized in future work.

## *Implications for Classroom Practices and Intervention*
With inattention symptom levels decelerating over time while hyperactivity/impulsivity persists, a question of clini- cal relevance should be considered: Are business-as-usual classroom practices more effective in addressing inattention as opposed to hyperactive and impulsive behaviors? Though the present study results may simply represent a natural pro- gression of symptoms, it is also possible that environmental factors, such as teacher experience, teacher behavior man- agement practices, or classroom structure, may play a role. Indeed, a growing body of work has examined various con- textual teacher/classroom variables associated with young children’s development of cognitive, social, and self-regu- lation skills (e.g., Hamre et al., 2014). However, without specific data on classroom and teacher level factors and practices, we can only speculate as to their influence. Based on the results of this study, future work should explore whether teachers are more likely to utilize effective atten- tion training tactics (e.g., “1, 2, 3, eyes on me”) as compared to techniques to address hyperactivity/impulsivity. Results from this study paired with future work in this domain can provide important information on ways to improve class- room practices that effectively target ADHD symptoms in preschool populations.

Moreover, the lack of any decreasing IA or HI symptom trajectory group warrants our attention. Although many teachers, clinicians, and other providers might adopt a “wait and see” approach in order to avoid overpathologizing nor- mative behaviors, results from the current study suggest that, on average, symptom elevations either remain stable or increase over the course of the year. Though certainly in need of replication, our findings suggest that we should not dismiss elevated ADHD symptoms in early childhood as transient or time limited. Of note, children in this study who had some degree of symptom elevation but were below the typical clinical cutoff for ADHD (e.g., IA Change and HI Increasing groups) showed more impairment at the end of the year than children following stable low symptom trajec- tories. This finding underscores a clear need for targeted prevention-focused interventions that do not require a diag- nosis in order to address potential ADHD symptom-related impairments. This prevention approach is especially impor- tant among preschool populations to ensure we do

not overpathologize normative behaviors among young children but, at the same time, do not miss an important opportunity for early intervention/prevention. Consideration of school-based tier 1 (universal prevention) and tier 2 (tar- geted for at-risk populations) interventions should be high priority for future work. In sum, results from this study, along with the broader literature, sup- port the adoption of proactive screening and intervention approaches for preschool children.

## *Strengths and Limitations*
This study was unique in its ability to examine four assess- ments of ADHD symptoms over the course of one academic year, yielding important information regarding symptom trajectories during a time of rapid developmental change. However, this study was limited in its ability to shed light on symptom trajectories and impairments beyond a single academic year, and thus conclusions regarding symptom trajectories must account for the short-term nature of the study design. Another limitation of this work is the small sample which impacted our person-centered analysis by preventing the use of a full GMM. A larger sample across more classrooms is needed in future work to ensure ample power to detect latent groups, increase generalizability, and account for classroom-level factors that may influence ADHD symptom level trajectories.

Given all of the limitations of past research in this area, study strengths included the use of teacher ratings, examina- tion of IA and HI trajectories separately, and inclusion of all

18 DSM-based ADHD symptoms. Although the use of teacher data was a significant strength in this study, a lack of parent data and multiple sources of impairment data is a limi- tation. Future work that includes multiple raters and objective executive functioning and performance-based impairment measures will strengthen our understanding of factors that influence how ADHD symptoms and related impairments develop and change across contexts/raters over time.

Another strength of this study was the use of a diverse sample, including a high proportion of racial/ethnic minor- ity children and socioeconomically disadvantaged youth. This study’s sample characteristics are particularly notable given this area of the literature has been criticized for a lack of diversity (Lee et al., 2016) and the use of a community sample allows for the examination of a full range of natu- rally occurring symptom variability. Importantly, this study was not designed to provide a nuanced understanding of variation in symptom trajectories by various sociodemo- graphic factors. Further understanding of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in the identification and diagno- sis of ADHD across the early education setting is a critical area for future research and will be necessary to develop a comprehensive and equitable system for early identification and prevention/intervention of ADHD.
